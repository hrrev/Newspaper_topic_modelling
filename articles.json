To synthesize their knowledge, students write monologues from the perspectives of Palestinian and Israeli students, imagining their opinions or experiences of some of the events included in the timeline.\nAuthor(s):\nSierra Prasada Millman, The New York Times Learning Network\nJavaid Khan, The Bank Street College of Education in New York City\nSuggested Time Allowance: 1 hour\nObjectives:\nStudents will:\n1. Analyze the conflicting roles that morality and pragmatism play in war.\n2. Study the most recent Israeli response to terrorism, the killing of Sheik Ahmed Yassin, by reading and discussing the article \u201cDeath of Sheik Raises Question of Hamas Fate.\u201d\n3. Research and create a timeline documenting Israel\u2019s evolving response to terrorism since its statehood in 1948.\n4. Prepare monologues that take the perspectives of Israeli and Palestinian students, in which they imagine the characters\u2019 opinions and experiences of specific events included in the timeline.\nResources / Materials:\n-pens/pencils\n-classroom blackboard\n-eight large pieces of paper\n-four markers\n-index cards with small group instructions, as explained in the Warm-Up activity\n-tape or push pins\n-copies of the article \u201cDeath of Sheik Raises Question of Hamas Fate\u201d (one per student)\n-resources for researching the Israeli response to terrorism since 1948 (textbooks and library resources, computers with Internet access)\nActivities / Procedures:\n1. WARM-UP/DO-NOW: Prior to class, arrange desks into four groups, and place a large piece of paper and a marker at each grouping. At two of the groupings of desks, place an index card with the following instructions written on it:\nYour group represents a minority population in your country. You are waging a war against the government and a foreign power that has intervened on behalf of the status quo (the existing way that life is lived in your country). Generate a list of your group\u2019s likely objectives and suggest possible strategies by which you will most likely achieve those aims. Record your thoughts on the piece of paper provided to create a \u201cstrategy poster.\u201d\nAt the other two groupings of desks, place an index card with the following instructions written on it:\nYou represent a government that has been waged war upon by a minority group in your country. A foreign power has intervened on your behalf. Generate a list of your group\u2019s likely objectives and suggest possible strategies by which you will most likely achieve those aims. Record your thoughts on the piece of paper provided to create a \u201cstrategy poster.\u201d Consider whether the government\u2019s and the foreign power\u2019s objectives and strategies differ from each other.\nAllow groups about fifteen minutes to respond to their instructions. Groups should hang their posters around the room and present their posters to the class in order to compare and contrast responses. Then, ask students to consider the morality and practicality of the actions advocated by each group. Students should give examples (and explain their reasons) of actions they consider moral, actions they consider immoral, actions they consider pragmatic and actions they consider most likely to be effective. Record each list on the board and encourage students to draw conclusions about the conflicting roles that morality and pragmatism play in war. Other questions to stimulate discussion include:\n\u2013What role do the general circumstances that inspired the combatants\u2019 aims (oppression, poverty, lack of resources, etc.) play in shaping the perceived morality of their actions? Can the same action be moral in one circumstance and immoral in another? Why or why not?\n\u2013Under what circumstances, if any, does pragmatism trump morality? Under what circumstances, if any, does morality trump pragmatism?\n\u2013Would an intervening foreign power be subject to different moral guidelines than the in-country combatants? Why or why not?\n2. As a class, read and discuss the article \u201cDeath of Sheik Raises Question of Hamas Fate,\u201d focusing on the following questions:\na. Who was Sheik Ahmed Yassin?\nb. What \u201cwager\u201d did Israel engage by killing Sheik Yassin, according to the article?\nc. What impact have \u201ctwo years of systematic Israeli raids against Hamas and other violent Palestinian groups\u201d had on suicide bombings and Israeli deaths?\nd. How have Palestinians responded to the Sheik\u2019s death?\ne. How does Boaz Ganor, head of the International Policy Institute for Counter-Terrorism in Israel, suggest the Sheik\u2019s killing has influenced Hamas\u2019s \u201coverall capacity to deliver attacks\u201d and \u201cmotivation\u201d?\nf. How does he predict the killing will affect Hamas in the long term?\ng. How does Mr. Ganor describe Sheik Yassin\u2019s role in Hamas?\nh. How, in 2000, did Sheik Yassin predict that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict would eventually conclude?\ni. What kind of man was Sheik Yassin (appearance, voice, social habits, etc.), according to the article?\nj. How prominent a role does Hamas play in suicide bombings, according to the article?\nk. Did Palestinians consider Sheik Yassin a political or a military figure in Hamas, according to the article? Did Israelis agree? Why or why not?\nl. What power did Hamas\u2019s \u201clarge following and its ability to carry out bombings consistently\u201d give it, according to the article?\nm. Which two Israeli officials opposed the operation? What reason did Avraham Poraz, the Israeli interior minister, give for his opposition?\nn. What \u201csimilar wager in 1996\u2033 do opponents draw again to critique the operation? How did Hamas respond to that operation?\no. When did Israel begin attacking top Hamas political figures?\np. Who is Ziad Abu Amr? What did he suggest about Sheik Yassin and the operation? Why does Mr. Ganor disagree?\nq. What is Sheik Yassin\u2019s personal history?\n3. Explain to students that each of their groups will be contributing to a timeline documenting the history of Israel\u2019s evolving response to terrorism since its statehood in 1948. Assign group to cover fourteen years (1948 \u2013 1962, 1962 \u2013 1976, 1976 \u2013 1990, and 1990 \u2013 2004). First, using all available classroom resources, each group should consider the following questions for each terrorist event in Israel in their time period and Palestinian and Israeli responses (written on the board for easier student access):\n\u2013Who were the major players, both Palestinian and Israeli?\n\u2013What motivated the terrorists? What were their objectives?\n\u2013What roles did civilians, soldiers, political officials and other organizations (both Israeli and Palestinian) play in the incident and responses?\n\u2013What motivated the Israeli (or other) response to terrorism?\n\u2013What kind of collateral damage did the terrorist incident and/or responses cause?\n\u2013How did the incident impact the developing peace process, if at all? Why?\nAfter research is complete, each group should create a timeline on a large piece of paper. Give students time at the end of class to make one timeline out of the four, read and take notes from it, and ask questions.\n4. WRAP-UP/HOMEWORK: To synthesize the classroom activities, each student in each group should select a different incident from his or her group\u2019s timeline and write a monologue from the perspective of an Israeli or a Palestinian student with regards to that incident. In the monologue, the student should imagine the character\u2019s opinions and experiences of the specific event. Monologues should be performed in a later class.\nFurther Questions for Discussion:\n\u2013Does the article imply that the \u201ctwo years of systematic Israeli raids\u201d directly contributed to the decrease in suicide bombings and Israeli deaths? Do you find the claim persuasive? Why or why not?\n\u2013Do you agree with the argument that Sheik Yassin may be \u201cirreplaceable\u201d? Are leaders ever irreplaceable?\n\u2013Is the killing made \u201cworse\u201d by the Sheik\u2019s status as a quadriplegic? Why or why not?\n\u2013If the Sheik was not directly involved in planning attacks, did he still, as the spiritual leader of Hamas, bear responsibility for its killings?\n\u2013Why have Hamas\u2019s (and other organizations\u2019) suicide bombings threatened to derail the peace process in Israel? Is there a way for Israeli political officials to limit their influence, even if they are unable to stop the violence?\n\u2013Considering the impact of the 1996 killing of Yahya Ayyash, what influence could the Sheik\u2019s killing have on future Israeli politics and life?\n\u2013Why might Israel have previously refrained from targeting Hamas\u2019s \u201ctop political figures\u201d? What do you think motivated the change?\n\u2013Sentenced to life in prison, Yassin was then freed in an exchange of prisoners. Are such exchanges just? Are they effective? What is the reasoning behind them?\nEvaluation / Assessment:\nStudents will be evaluated based on participation in the initial task and subsequent class discussion, contribution to the timeline, and thoughtful completion of the monologue.\nVocabulary:\nSheik, Hamas, wagering, faction, retaliate, revenge, generated, surge, retaliatory, slain, strategic, absolutist, rasp, frailties, prominence, founder, Islamic, identified, distinguish, division, authorizing, initiating, archterrorist, negotiations, disrupt, derail, electoral, maintained, core, constituency, assassination, militant, ultraradical, sketchy, erupted\nExtension Activities:\n1. Write a response paper after viewing the New York Times slide show \u201cPalestinian Reaction,\u201d found at //www.nytimes.com/2004/03/23/international/middleeast/23YASS.html. Let the following questions guide your response:\n\u2013How do the photographs characterize the Palestinian response to the Sheik\u2019s death? Is the word \u201cmourning\u201d appropriate? Why or why not?\n\u2013What about the Jordanian response? Why might the citizens of other Arab countries be upset by the Sheik\u2019s death?\n\u2013Were there any women protesters represented in the photos? Why do you think that is?\n\u2013What symbols of oppression and resistance are included in the photographs? Are they effective? Why or why not?\n\u2013What might a Palestinian think and feel on seeing these photographs?\n\u2013What might an Israeli think and feel?\n\u2013What do you think and feel?\n2. Create a collage that represents, in images and brief text, the following statement: \u201cOne man\u2019s terrorist is another man\u2019s freedom fighter.\u201d Most images should clearly represent either \u201cterrorism\u201d or \u201cfreedom fighting.\u201d When finished, write one paragraph relating your response to the statement and explaining how the collage reflects your opinion.\n3. Draw and label your own series of trading cards, each card representing a major player in the history of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict since 1948 (such as Menachem Begin, Yasser Arafat, Bill Clinton, etc.) Include for each a photograph, a brief description of his or her role in the conflict, and a noteworthy quotation.\n4. Write a position paper that either defends or refutes government-sponsored assassinations. Consider the direct or indirect roles that the United States and other countries have played in such actions and their impact. Are such killings morally justifiable? Are they strategically sound? Why or why not? Provide and analyze specific examples of leaders who were assassinated, leaders who escaped assassination, and/or leaders who were provided with exile.\nInterdisciplinary Connections:\nAmerican History- Construct a chart that documents American presidential responses to and interventions in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict since 1948 and assesses their individual contributions. Which presidents were the most involved? Which presidents were the least involved? What steps did they take? Were they successful? Why or why not?\nCivics- Compose two letters that an American and an Israeli soldier might have written to each other, relating their unique experience of the Iraq war and service in the occupied territories, respectively. The correspondence needs to provide the reader with enough information to encourage an authentic comparison/contrast of American and Israeli military service. Students may want to consult the official Web sites of the Israeli Defense Forces (//www.idf.il) and the United States Army (//www.army.mil/).\nMedia Studies- Create a presentation comparing coverage of the Sheik\u2019s killing in American, French, Israeli and Palestinian media. Consider the different perspectives taken by journalists, subjects interviewed, events included, and photographs or graphics. Students will want to visit the NewsDirectory at //www.ecola.com and the official Web site of Al Jazeera (//english.aljazeera.net/HomePage).\nJournalism- Imagine that you have the opportunity to interview Sheik Yassin after his death. What questions might you ask him? How might he respond? Transcribe a fictional interview, soliciting the Sheik\u2019s opinion in the Israeli-Palestinian crisis, the United States, the afterlife, and his reaction to the funeral.\nTechnology- Design an interactive Web site that educates visitors on the history of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. How might the site inform and entertain simultaneously? Would it include a flash timeline, quizzes, links, etc.? Be creative. Provide a few examples of the specific content of each page.\nAcademic Content Standards:\nGrades 6-8\nWorld History Standard 43- Understands how post-World War II reconstruction occurred, new international power relations took shape, and colonial empires broke up.

But rock formed from sediments from evaporating standing water, like those at the site, ''offers excellent capability for preserving evidence of any biochemical or biological material that may have been in the water,'' he said.\nThe rover Opportunity landed on a plain called Meridiani Planum on Jan. 25, three weeks after the Spirit touched down on the opposite side of the planet at a site called Gusev Crater. NASA officials said Tuesday that the two craft were operating so well that their original 90-day missions would very likely extend into the summer.\nDr. Edward Weiler, NASA's associate administrator for space science, said that when researchers first announced on March 2 that the Opportunity had found rocks that formed in the presence of water, there was some indication that the water pooled on the surface. But to be sure that they were interpreting the data correctly, Dr. Weiler said, they sent it to several outside experts for review before Tuesday's announcement.\nOne of those scientists, Dr. David Rubin, a sedimentary expert with the United States Geological Survey in Santa Cruz, Calif., said he was shocked when he received the Mars pictures from NASA. ''I was astonished,'' Dr. Rubin said. ''They looked like sedimentary deposits found at a beach on Earth.''\nDr. Rubin told the news conference that some of the pictures showed rocks that could have been formed by particles deposited by the wind, and others by sediments put down by water. However, he said, there are features in some of the formations that require flowing water, which supports the explanations by the rover scientists.\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

This would be like some salt flats on Earth, which are periodically submerged, Dr. Grotzinger said.\nTo examine the patterns in the Mars outcroppings, the Opportunity used a microscopic camera on its robot arm to take multiple postage-stamp-sized pictures that were put together into mosaics to examine the layering in the rock.\nThe close-up pictures revealed that the sediments that bonded to form the rocks were in uneven layers distorted by the ripples of flowing water, patterns called crossbedding and festooning, Dr. Grotzinger said.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nPatterns in some of the layered rocks indicate they were shaped by ripples at least two inches deep, and possibly much deeper, flowing at a speed of 4 to 20 inches per second, he said.\nThe patterns include distinctive, upward-turning curves characteristic of water depositing particles in layers rather than wind, he said.\nIn further evidence of water formation, Dr. Grotzinger said, the rover found chlorine and bromine salts in the rocks, suggesting that salt concentrations were rising while water was evaporating.\nDr. Weiler said the findings would spur efforts to expand Mars exploration and look for evidence of past or current life. He noted that NASA planned to send the Mars Science Laboratory, a more sophisticated rover that will do detailed life-science testing, to the planet in 2009 and that Meridiani was now a prime site.\nTo search for further evidence of Martian water, the Opportunity has climbed out of its landing site and will head for a crater named Endurance, 2,300 feet away. That crater, scientists said, may have even deeper rock formations.Scientists Report Evidence Of Saltwater Pools on Mars", "WALLIN--Alan A. On March 23 after a lengthy illness.

Gujarat, where many of New York City's Indian high-tech workers come from, has a particularly high percentage of vegetarians. ''They are bachelors, these guys,'' said Sridhar Rathnam, the chef and an owner of Madras Cafe in the East Village. ''So they don't know how to cook. And they need restaurants.''\nWith the arrival here of South Indian vegetarian staples like dosas and uttapams, samosa chat and idlis, Indian cooking in New York is finally reflecting how Indians eat in India. And that often means vegetarian meals at least twice a day, or an entirely vegetarian home kitchen.\nIndian restaurants outside India have rarely reflected the central role of vegetarian cooking in Indian life, or its varied flavors. Where Americans see ''vegetable curries,'' Indian cooks distinguish among dry and sauced, southern-style (flavored with mustard seeds and curry leaves) and Northern-style (cooked in tomatoes and onions), chili-hot and creamy-cool dishes. To one who eats this way from birth, Mr. Rathnam said, ''a dish that is spicy and sweet tastes completely different to one that is spicy and sour.''\nPart of the craft of Indian vegetarian cooking is composing thalis, plates of rice, bread, dal and cooked vegetables in which the textures and flavors are full of difference and surprise. Even modest establishments like Minar and Dimple present their food with garnishes of crunchy vegetables -- sliced cucumbers, whole fresh chilies, whole radishes -- that are there to provide fresh contrast to the hot food. At Roomali, which just opened on East 27th Street, the vegetarian staple paneer, a fresh cheese, is rolled up in hot roti with shreds of raw red onion.\nIn Ayurveda, the traditional Hindu system of human biology and medicine, foods -- like people -- are either hot or cold, and should be combined accordingly. Additionally, food can be broken down into six flavors -- salty, sweet, sour, bitter, astringent and pungent -- that should be balanced at each meal. Tirlok Malik, an owner of the Ayurveda Cafe on the Upper West Side, said, ''Ayurveda is all about balance.'' At the Ayurveda Cafe, a complete vegetarian thali is composed daily and served in its entirety to each diner (Thali in Greenwich Village and Vatan on Lexington Avenue operate on the same principle).\nMany Ayurveda practitioners, Jains, Buddhist monks and Krishna worshipers do not eat any onion or garlic -- these pungent foods are considered too ''hot'' and stimulating. It is hard to imagine a vegetarian cook functioning without onions, garlic, scallions, or shallots, but Mr. Rathnam said that vegetarian cooks in India have a much wider range of vegetables to choose from. ''Americans are accustomed to thinking of India as a poor country,'' he said. ''But in Madras you can buy three different kinds of radishes, carrots that are red and yellow as well as orange, all kinds of leafy greens, fresh spices, baby eggplants, shoestring beans, jackfruit and all different kinds of mangoes.''\nNitu Singh, an owner of Minar in Midtown, says that more and more Indian vegetables are available here, and that more customers order them. ''Ten years ago, only Indians ordered okra,'' he said. At Chinese Mirch, a new Indian-Chinese restaurant on Lexington Avenue (Chinese is a popular cuisine in many parts of India), nearly every table holds a mountain of crisp-fried whole okra pods, sprinkled with smoky chili powder.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nBeyond vegetables themselves, rice and bread are integral to vegetarian eating. Especially in South India, the word ''bread'' does not really begin to describe the range of savory pancakes, crepes, doughnuts, and plain and stuffed flatbreads that make quick, filling, savory meals for millions every day.\nDosas are lacy, chewy flatbreads, very thin and crisp, with a pleasant sourness that comes from fermenting the rice-and-lentil batter overnight. The dosa can be eaten plain or folded around a filling to make a speedy breakfast that's as integral to Madras as egg and cheese on a roll is to New York. The fundamental filling is the spiced potato mixture known as masala, but there are many variations: mysore (with chili powder sprinkled between the bread layers), butter (extra-thin and buttery), rava (made from wheat instead of rice); and others with onion or cheese sprinkled inside. Listening to Indians order dosas is like listening to Seattle residents order coffee.\nYou can best do this in New York City in Queens, at the Dosa Hutt, the canteen attached to the Ganesha temple in Flushing, where the dosas are smoky from the griddle and brushed with lashings of ghee, or clarified butter. The unrelated Dosa Hut on Lexington Avenue is closed for renovations, but its signature dish, when it returns, should still be the tenderest in Manhattan. Once folded, a normal dosa is about two feet long (a new vegetarian restaurant coming to Manhattan, Saravanas, promises six-foot dosas).\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

When well-made, idlis have the pillowy texture and light tang of the perfect buttermilk pancake. Uttapams are also something like pancakes, but the batter is poured around tomatoes, mushrooms, onions or mushrooms, to make tender, vegetable-studded rounds.\nIdlis and uttapams are always served with a bowl of sambar, a soupy, tangy tamarind-spiked stew of lentils and vegetables that is synonymous with South Indian cooking. Mr. Rathnam says that in South India, ''we judge a cook by her sambar.'' A cup of creamy-sweet coconut chutney is invariably presented too, to round out the flavors, making this a highly satisfying simple meal. Some of the best idlis in New York are served at Madras Cafe and at Chennai Garden, both vegetarian and kosher-certified restaurants that opened in 1999. Chennai Garden, along with Curry Leaf, has some of the best food in the neighborhood known as Curry Hill, which radiates out from Lexington Avenue and 28th Street.\nAt Chennai Garden's lunch buffet last week, visiting engineering students from Hyderabad lined up alongside American Muslim women and kosher-observant New Yorkers like Leah Kahalani. Ms. Kahalani, whose father was a Jewish Indian raised in Mumbai, said the new Indian vegetarian food is the best in the city. ''We used to make samosas for Shabbat dinner when I was growing up,'' she said. ''This cooking is so much more interesting than most vegetarian and kosher food.''\nLavina Melwani, a writer in New York who grew up in Delhi, has been a vegetarian for 15 years and considers the changes in New York's Indian restaurants to be remarkable. ''Now in Midtown you can get a totally traditional chole batura for breakfast,'' she said, referring to a spicy chickpea stew served with crisp, puffy bread, ''and then have a dosa for lunch. When I moved here, there was nothing Indian vegetarians could eat, except for pizza.''\nPizza is still a staple for New York's Indian-Americans, especially young ones. Singas Famous Pizza, originally a Greek-owned family storefront in Elmhurst, Queens, has become a six-store franchise with a cult following. The distinctive Singas tomato sauce is heavily dosed with fresh jalape\u00f1os. The owner of the Hicksville franchise, Jai Jeyasri, said that about 40 percent of his customers are Indian. ''Singas pizza is even too spicy for me,'' he said. ''But I like a mysore dosa.''\nFrom Queens to Curry Hill\nHere are a few Indian vegetarian restaurants in New York:\nAYURVEDA CAFE, 706 Amsterdam Avenue (94th Street), (212) 932-2400.\nCHENNAI GARDEN, 127 East 27th Street, (212) 689-1999.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nDIMPLE, 11 West 30th Street, (212) 643-9464; and 35-68 73rd Street, Jackson Heights, Queens, (718) 458-8144.\nDOSA HUTT, 45-63 Bowne Street (45th Avenue), Flushing, Queens, (718) 961-5897.\nMADRAS CAFE, 79 Second Avenue (Fourth Street), (212) 254-8002.\nVATAN, 409 Third Avenue (29th Street), (212) 689-5666.\nTHALI, 28 Greenwich Avenue (10th Street), (212) 367-7411.\nHere are a few restaurants -- Indian, Indian-Chinese and in one case Indian-Italian -- that serve meat dishes but also have extensive vegetarian offerings on their menus:\nAMMA, 246 East 51st Street, (212) 644-8330.\nSAPPHIRE, 1845 Broadway (61st Street), (212) 245-4444.\nTAMARIND, 41 East 22nd Street, (212) 674-7400.\nMINAR, 5 West 31st Street, (212) 967-2727.\nROOMALI, 97 Lexington Avenue (27th Street), (212) 679-8900.\nCHINESE MIRCH, 120 Lexington Avenue (28th Street), (212) 532-3663.\nSINGAS FAMOUS PIZZA, locations in Queens, Long Island and New Jersey, (732) 549-8665.\nCorrection: March 31, 2004, Wednesday An article last Wednesday about Indian vegetarian restaurants in New York misstated the address of Vatan.

Democrats, while asserting that the Medicare program was not in crisis, nevertheless said President Bush had aggravated its problems.\nThe report comes less than two weeks after the Medicare actuary asserted that the administration ordered him to withhold higher cost estimates for the Medicare legislation last year.\nThe trustees made three blunt statements that highlighted the problems:\n*Under current law, Medicare's hospital insurance trust fund, which pays for inpatient hospital care, will be exhausted in 2019, seven years earlier than forecast last year.\n*Medicare will grow much faster than the economy as a whole, increasing from 2.6 percent of the gross domestic product last year to 3.7 percent in 2010, 7.7 percent in 2035 and nearly 14 percent at the end of the 75-year period commonly used for long-range projections.\n*''Projected Medicare costs would exceed those for Social Security in 2024. By 2078, the level of Medicare expenditures would represent nearly twice the cost of Social Security.''\nThe new figures touched off a political brawl between Democrats and the White House.\n''In just one year, George Bush's reckless policies have sped Medicare seven years closer to bankruptcy,'' said Senator John Kerry, the likely Democratic presidential nominee.\nBush administration officials said Medicare's financial problems would be far worse if Democrats had prevailed in their effort to pass drug legislation costing twice as much as the new law.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nThe board of trustees consists of four administration officials and two public representatives, Mr. Palmer and Thomas R. Saving, an economist at Texas A&M University.\nIn a joint statement, the public trustees said that surging Medicare costs, combined with the new drug benefit, ''raise serious doubt about the sustainability of Medicare under current financing arrangements.''\nMoreover, the full board said, the fiscal outlook may be worse than the official projections indicate, because the estimates are based on the unrealistic assumption that the average Medicare fee for doctors' services will be cut about 5 percent each year from 2006 to 2012, as required under current rules. Doctors say they will lobby Congress to prevent such cuts.\nThough issued by the Bush administration, the Medicare report was prepared mainly by the office of the actuary, Richard S. Foster, a longtime civil servant who recently stirred up a political row when he said he had been ordered to withhold some of his cost estimates from Congress. In the last year, he wrote, ''the financial status of the hospital insurance trust fund has deteriorated significantly.''\nFor example, the report says, tax revenues earmarked for the hospital trust fund will fall short of outlays beginning this year, not in 2013, as the trustees predicted last March. Similar shortfalls have occurred in the past.\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter.

They insisted on Tuesday that Medicare was not facing a fiscal crisis, and they said they saw no reason for alarm. But at the same time, Democrats blamed President Bush for Medicare's problems.\nSenator Kerry said Mr. Bush had had an opportunity to shore up Medicare's finances, but squandered it by providing ''tax breaks for the wealthy and a giveaway to prescription drug companies.''\nTrent D. Duffy, a White House spokesman, fired back, saying: ''John Kerry would like to steal the drug benefit away from seniors before they even get it. This president won't allow him to do that. This president has delivered; Democrats have made empty promises for more than a decade.''\nMoreover, Mr. Duffy said that Medicare's financial problems resulted more from rising health costs in general than from the drug benefit proposed by Mr. Bush and approved by Congress last year.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nBut the trustees said the drug benefit would be a major factor adding to Medicare's fiscal problems.\nThe trustees said that total Medicare spending on the drug benefit would start at $85 billion a year in 2006 and would then grow an average of 9.6 percent a year, to $161.8 billion in 2013.\nIn a separate analysis, the trustees said that the Social Security trust fund would be exhausted in 2042, but that annual costs would exceed tax revenues starting in 2018. Those dates are the same as in last year's report.\nSocial Security officials emphasized that the program would not stop paying benefits even under those assumptions. While the assets of the trust fund would be depleted in 2042, they said, tax income would still cover 73 percent of benefit costs.\nMedicare's hospital insurance trust fund, which now accounts for 55 percent of Medicare spending, has been a widely used gauge of the program's financial condition. It fluctuates from year to year.\nRobert D. Reischauer, president of the Urban Institute and a former director of the Congressional Budget Office, said: ''The date of insolvency moved forward seven years. By my way of calculating, that's the largest deterioration since we began doing these projections in 1970.''\nTrustees listed several reasons for the worsening condition of the hospital trust fund. Spending was a little higher than expected last year, and payroll tax collections were lower than expected, because of ''very slow growth in wages in 2003,'' the report said.\nIn addition, it said, the new Medicare law will significantly increase costs for the trust fund, ''primarily through increased payments to rural hospitals and private health plans.''\nThe report is full of complex statistics, but the two public trustees explained their significance. In 2003, they observed, premiums and co-payments for a typical Medicare beneficiary amounted to 15 percent of the average Social Security benefit. By contrast, they said, premiums and co-payments for doctors' services and the new drug benefit will exceed 35 percent of the average Social Security benefit in 2010 and 50 percent by 2030.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nTommy G. Thompson, the secretary of health and human services, is one of the Medicare trustees, but he said he believed that some provisions of the new law would save more money than the actuary or other budget experts anticipated.\nFor example, Mr. Thompson said, new preventive health benefits, greater use of generic drugs and coordinated care for chronic illnesses should save money.\nBut Representative Pete Stark of California, the senior Democrat on the Ways and Means Subcommittee on Health, said he never expected to see those savings. Indeed, he said, the new Medicare law, by ''lavishing billions of dollars'' on private plans, drains the trust fund.Medicare Overseers Expect Costs to Soar In Coming Decades", "New York officials to unveil plan to build New York Jets 75,000-seat stadium with retractable roof on Manhattan's far West Side, and to almost double size of Javits Convention Center; photo; ambitious urban redevelopment would bring professional football back to Manhattan; $2.8-billion New York Sports and Convention Center plan is tied to proposal to host 2012 Summer Olympics and extend subway service west; funding would include $600 million each from city and state, $500 million from temporary hotel tax and $800 million from Jets; $1.4-billion stadium is most controversial element; Javits expansion has wide support (M)Despite the push by the governor and the mayor, the projects still face a series of hurdles, including an environmental review, zoning approvals, state legislation for the Javits expansion and any legal actions.\nThe project would be financed with $600 million each from the city and state, $500 million from a temporary hotel tax, $800 million from the Jets and the remainder from other private sources.\nThe $1.4 billion stadium has been the project's most debated element. While the $1.4 billion Javits expansion has wide support, some Broadway theater owners, community groups and elected officials fear the stadium will displace working-class residents and increase traffic congestion and pollution. Most everyone predicts there will be lawsuits.\nTo blunt criticism by economists that stadiums are poor public investments, the city has worked with the Jets to design the stadium so that it can be used for conventions, trade shows, meetings and plenary sessions, as well as concerts and other sporting events.\nThe stadium would also double as the Olympic stadium if the city wins its bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics. The city is eager to move the projects forward now, in part, because it wants to show some progress before the International Olympic Committee meets in May to pare its list of candidates for the 2012 Games. The committee will make its final decision in July 2005. The Jets want to start construction next year so they can move into their new home when their current lease expires in 2008.\nOpinions vary on the city's Olympic chances, but real estate and business leaders favor the redevelopment of the far West Side. The city is in the process of rezoning the neighborhood to encourage the development of 30 million square feet of office space over the next 30 years. It also wants to extend the No. 7 subway line west from Times Square underneath 41st Street to 11th Avenue and then south to 34th Street.\nThe announcement tomorrow will come a month after Deputy Mayor Daniel L. Doctoroff proposed a $3.7 billion financing plan to cover the extension of the subway line, create new parks and build a massive deck over a different section of the rail yards, where office buildings and a cultural institution could be built.\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Wylde, president of the Partnership for New York City. ''And the redevelopment of the far West Side is critical to the future of the city.''\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nSheldon Silver, the speaker of the State Assembly, also supports the Javits expansion, but said ''the jury is still out'' on the stadium.\n''We have to look at it very carefully,'' he said.\nAnd Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky, a Democrat from Westchester County, called for more public discussion about the use of scarce public resources for stadiums and the subway extension. ''This has been a back-room operation so far,'' he said. ''There's growing sentiment that it needs a public airing, pro and con.''\nAccording to state and city officials, the governor will announce the $1.4 billion plan to expand the Javits center north from 38th to 40th Streets. With more exhibition space and meeting rooms, it will be able to attract larger conventions and present more than one trade show at a time, officials say.\nThe cost of the Javits project will be covered by $300 million from the city; the $1.50-a-night hotel tax, which would expire once the $500 million goal is met; and the refinancing of the bonds on the Javits. State officials also hope to guarantee the bonds by using the state's Sonny Mae mortgage insurance.\nThey are also hoping that a private company will chip in $200 million for a proposed convention hotel on 42nd Street, although in other cities the hotels have required substantial subsidies.\nThe Jets have agreed to put up $800 million for the stadium over the rail yards bound by 11th and 12th Avenues, between 30th and 34th Streets.\nThe $600 million from the state and city would pay for the retractable roof and the platform on which the stadium would be built.\nThe Jets would also pay an undetermined rent to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which owns the rail yards, according to executives on both sides. The transit agency is also close to an agreement with the city over compensation for the use of the yards, state and city officials said.\nCorrection: March 25, 2004, Thursday A front-page credit yesterday for a rendering of the proposed Jets stadium in Manhattan misspelled part of the architectural firm's name.

In a deal brokered by state Attorney General Eliot Spitzer on opening day last season, Cablevision agreed to offer YES for one year to those subscribers who already received premium packages as a stand-alone channel for $1.95 a month, or with the MSG Network and Fox Sports New York for $4.95 a month. Cablevision has about 1.5 million YES subscribers.\nBut the arbitrators apparently accepted YES's argument, which was based on how other regional sports networks are carried and how they are priced, and ruled that Cablevision must carry YES on expanded basic and to guarantee payments to the Yankees' cable network based on 90 percent of its subscribers.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nIn ruling to put YES on Cablevision's expanded basic, which has about 2.5 million customers, the executives said the arbitrators reduced the monthly subscriber fee Cablevision will pay for it.

In London, you have what the British call a gastropub. In Manhattan, you have a phenomenon.\nThe phenomenon du jour, the Spotted Pig, is one of the most crowded little restaurants in New York. People waiting for seats fill the bar area and spill out into the street.\nSome are no doubt attracted by the celebrity component: the mere mention of Mario Batali and Joe Bastianich, the team from Babbo, etc., who are investors in the Spotted Pig, seems enough to cause a culinary riot. Others may come for the rock royalty connection. (Ken Friedman, the principal owner, is a veteran of the music industry, who counts Bono among his investors.) Still others may have heard about the restaurant's young English chef, April Bloomfield, who has cooked at both River Cafe, the groundbreaking Italian restaurant in London, and Chez Panisse in Berkeley, Calif.\nAll of these would pique curiosity about any restaurant. But the Spotted Pig succeeds because it does not settle for star power. Instead, it relies on a winning confluence of casual yet imaginative food served in an easygoing, almost rustic atmosphere, where worn-velvet banquettes are strewn with pillows and pig paraphernalia adorn the walls. Music is loud but not too loud, a good match for the exuberance of the patrons.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nOn my first visit, I liked the look and feel of the place, which was previously Le Zoo. But the food -- even seemingly lusty preparations like shepherd's pie ($17), pork sausage with polenta ($15) and slow-braised beef shin with escarole ($18) -- was timidly seasoned. I could not figure out what made a nothing-fancy plate of roasted cauliflower and Jerusalem artichoke with braised Swiss chard worth more, at $10, than any other appetizer but raw oysters.$25 AND UNDER; A Little Big Deal on West 11th", "Jazz Pharmaceuticals, year-old company with no products on market, raises $250 million from private investors, apparently record amount for second round of venture capital financing in biotechnology; financing is led by affiliate of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co; Jazz chief executive Samuel R Saks comments (M)Jazz Pharmaceuticals, a year-old company with no products on the market, said yesterday that it had raised $250 million from private investors, apparently a record amount for a second round of venture capital financing in biotechnology.\nThe financing was led by an affiliate of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Company, representing the firm's first investment in a pharmaceutical company, according to a Kohlberg Kravis spokeswoman.\nJazz, based in Palo Alto, Calif., is planning to develop drugs for neurologic and psychiatric disorders, mainly by licensing compounds from other companies and, in some cases, improving upon them.

Ms. Ma was back at school, but only because her parents had borrowed money and her mother had taken a laborer's job to repay the loan.\nAfter meeting Ms. Ma and her parents the visitors gave them $120 to allow the 13-year-old to stay at school and her mother to pay off her loan.\n''For me that was it,'' Mr. Haski later recalled. ''We'd done our bit and would leave.''\nBut after Lib\u00e9ration published his article about Ma Yan and her plight on Jan. 11, 2002, Mr. Haski began receiving checks from readers. His instinct was to use the donations to keep other peasant girls in school. But he also received a proposal to publish Ms. Ma's journal in France, and he traveled to Zhang Jia Shu with a contract. By then Ms. Ma had filled another journal covering July 3 to Dec. 13, 2001. (Her father had used the paper of her journal for the early months of 2001 to roll cigarettes.) This diary was much more somber than the earlier one.\n''I'm terribly hungry,'' she writes. ''There's been no bread or vegetables since Tuesday. When I eat my rice now, there's nothing to go with it. I even stole a piece out of a comrade's bowl without alerting her. When she came back to the dormitory, she called me all manner of names.''

But today ----'' She reflects mournfully, ''Mother is the saddest and most unfortunate mother in the world.''\nBut with the advance paid by the French publishers things improved. Ms. Ma and Mr. Haski, who edited and annotated the book, decided to give 25 percent of their royalties to the Association for the Children of Ningxia, which Mr. Haski had set up in France after his first article appeared. After ''Ma Yan's Diary'' came out in France in October 2002, the association's membership grew to 300, and more donations poured in.

''Then I found myself in a situation where I could influence reality, but I had to live with that responsibility -- to Ma Yan but also to a region that in a sense we have destabilized.

''Ma Yan's Diary'' was published in China in October 2003, and its author appeared three times on government television. At a news conference she illustrated the fate of many poor peasant girls by reading a letter from a cousin forced to leave school and marry. ''By the time you receive this letter,'' the cousin wrote, ''I will already be in the palace of marriage, which is the tomb of my life.''\nAfter Ms. Ma finished reading the letter, Mr. Haski recalled, most of the reporters in her audience were in tears. Now, in Paris on her first trip outside China, Ms. Ma seems unfazed by the attention.''I can eat when I want to,'' she said in an interview. ''My parents don't have to travel to work. They have bought some land, a donkey, some sheep. They have a motorbike, a new television and a telephone. We have also repainted the house. I think that is enough.''\nBut she has bigger ambitions. ''I want to study journalism at university,'' she said. Asked why, she pointed to Mr. Haski, whom she calls Uncle Han. ''Because Uncle Han and others traveled across the country and found poor children like us,'' she said. ''I'd like to be a journalist so I, too, can help poor children.''\nMr. Haski conceded that early in this bizarre adventure he worried that Ms. Ma might be spoiled by her sudden fame and relative fortune. But now he feels reassured. ''Her teachers say she is still a good student who is generous with her colleagues,'' he said. Ms. Ma, too, seems aware that she still has far to go. ''To get to university in Beijing,'' she said, ''I have to do very well in the exams.''A Chinese Girl's Diary Builds A Bridge Out of Rural Poverty", "NeMr. Murdoch has tried for years to cross the English Channel, but as an outsider he has long met political opposition, and his one significant foray into Europe, in Germany, ended in failure. This time, though, the News Corporation has management control, which has allowed it to increase Sky Italia's programming with more sports, movies, nature programs and American shows.\nItaly has almost no cable networks and only about 12 percent of Italian homes with televisions have satellite connections used for paid programming, according to Auditel, which tracks the Italian market. That compares with almost 40 percent in Britain.\n''The growth potential is definitely there,'' said Daniele Ridolfi, an analyst with Banca Leonardo in Milan.\nBut Mr. Murdoch knew that a dearth of cable and legal satellite connections, along with improved programming, would not be enough to ensure success in Italy. Before the arrival of Sky Italia, it was estimated that for every person who paid for satellite television, someone else got it free, illegally. The News Corporation began using better encryption technology, which it says has greatly reduced such piracy.\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Those subscribers, who came from the two merged companies, will increase to 2.8 million by the end of 2004 and 3.5 million at the end of 2006, Mr. Murdoch said when he announced the creation of Sky Italia in October 2002. He also forecast a profit in 2005.\nWhile piracy has become less of an issue for Sky Italia, reaching the company's higher paid subscription targets could still be difficult.\n''They beat the pirates, but the problem is the company was banking on most of those pirates becoming paying clients, and it's not clear that's actually happening,'' said Fabrizio Perretti, a media professor at Bocconi University in Milan. ''The pirates have realized that if they can't get free satellite television, there are other options such as pirated DVD's and programming downloaded from the Internet.''\nSky Italia says it now has more than 2.5 million subscribers, bringing the company close to its year-end target of 2.8 million. Since Sky Italia is effectively in its start-up phase, it is difficult to know if that gain reflects consumer enthusiasm at the company's debut. In the quarter that ended Dec. 31, Sky Italia lost $106 million on sales of $421 million. There are no comparable year-ago figures, since Sky Italia began operations on Aug. 1.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nSky Italia also has to contend with Italy's two main broadcast networks, the state-run Rai television and Mediaset, the television company of Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi. While Rai and Mediaset, which together have more than 90 percent of the country's commercial television market, have been slow to respond to Sky Italia's challenge, they are expected to mount more serious competition once digital terrestrial becomes available, allowing them to offer more channels or to bundle channels from other companies.\nAnother challenge to Mr. Murdoch are regulations imposed by the European Union that bar companies like Sky Italia from having exclusive deals of more than two years with soccer teams -- a lucrative business. The teams can back out of their agreements with a year's notice. Regulators also imposed a three-year maximum on contracts between companies like Sky Italia and movie studios, with the same clause allowing for the early withdrawal.\nThe News Corporation already owned half of Stream, the smaller of Italy's two previous satellite companies, when it bought the other, Telepi\u00f9, in 2003 for about 900 million euros. Telecom Italia, Italy's dominant phone company, owned the other half of Stream and now owns 20 percent of Sky Italia.\nIf pirates are kept at bay, it will be Sky Italia's programming that decides the company's long-term fate. But all the right programming might not be enough. Professor Perretti at Bocconi University said, ''Most programming is substitutable to some extent, with the exception of live soccer games, but those can always be seen at a bar.''The Murdoch Empire Looks to Italian TV", "Adelphia Communications Corp wins Federal Bankruptcy Judge Robert E Gerber's approval of $1.94 billion settlement with its former telephone and Internet subsidiary Adelphia Business Solutions, which is now known as TelCove; Adelphia will drop $842 million claim, pay $60 million in cash and buy $39 million of telecommunications services over five years from TelCove; TelCove will drop as much as $1 billion in claims against Adelphia (S)The Adelphia Communications Corporation, the bankrupt cable-television provider whose founders are on trial for fraud, won a federal judge's approval of a $1.94 billion settlement with its former telephone and Internet subsidiary.

Mr. Rumsfeld questioned what more the Bush administration could have done. ''Even if bin Laden had been captured or killed in the weeks before Sept. 11, no one I know believes it would necessarily have prevented Sept. 11,'' he said. [Excerpts, Page A14.]\nPresident Bush joined in the defense of his administration's performance, telling reporters after a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday that if ''my administration had any information that terrorists were going to attack New York City on Sept. 11, we would have acted. We have been chasing down Al Qaeda ever since the attacks.''\nThe Bush administration has refused to discuss details of the Oval Office intelligence briefings in the months before the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. The reports, known as the President's Daily Brief, are among the most highly classified documents in the executive branch.\nBut under an agreement with the White House last year, one member of the commission, Jamie S. Gorelick, former deputy attorney general in the Clinton administration, was allowed to read through a full library of the briefings, and two other commissioners were allowed a partial review.\nMs. Gorelick said at the hearing Tuesday that information in the documents ''would set your hair on fire, and not just George Tenet's hair on fire,'' referring to the director of central intelligence.\nThough barred under secrecy regulations from discussing much of what was in the reports, she said that there had been ''an extraordinary spike'' of intelligence warning about Qaeda attacks in the Daily Brief during 2001 and that ''it plateaued at a spike level for months.''\nMs. Gorelick's comments came as the commission released a staff report finding that Mr. Rumsfeld did not order the preparation of any new military plans against Al Qaeda or its Taliban sponsors during the seven months between his arrival at the Pentagon and the Sept. 11 attacks.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nThe report said that despite the intelligence alerts throughout the year, there was an impression among specialists at the Pentagon that Mr. Rumsfeld and his new team were ''not especially interested in the counterterrorism agenda.''\nA separate staff report on the government's diplomatic response to the terrorist threat found that Condoleezza Rice, Mr. Bush's national security adviser, and her deputies rebuffed a proposal by aides in early 2001 that the administration step up its support for anti-Taliban rebels in Afghanistan.\nThe report said that Ms. Rice had instead spent more than seven months trying to formulate policies to deal with Al Qaeda and the Taliban, policies that were still not in place by Sept. 11 and, White House aides said, might have taken as long as three years to implement.\nMuch of the panel's questioning on Tuesday reflected partisan division on the commission, with Republicans harsher in their questions for Clinton administration officials and Democrats tougher on Mr. Rumsfeld and Mr. Powell. But Republicans joined in asking why the Bush administration had not done more in 2001 to respond to the intelligence suggesting an imminent Qaeda threat and why it had allowed the policy review on counterterrorism to drag on.\n''What made you think, even when you took over and got these first briefings, given the history of Al Qaeda and its successful attacks on Americans, that we had the luxury even of seven months before we could make any kind of response, much less three years?'' Slade Gorton, a Republican member of the commission and a former senator from Washington, asked Mr. Rumsfeld.\nThe defense secretary bristled at the question from his fellow Republican. ''I didn't come up with three years, and I can't defend that number,'' Mr. Rumsfeld said, adding that the administration had been trying at the time of the attacks to come up with a broad strategy to eradicate Al Qaeda.\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

''If we had such information, we could have acted on it.''\nThe staff reports are expected to become part of the commission's final report this summer, and together they detail how the Clinton and Bush administrations centered much of the government's counterterrorism efforts on fruitless negotiations with the Taliban before and after Sept. 11 to oust Mr. bin Laden from Afghanistan.\nThe reports, and some of the testimony on Tuesday, supported elements of the account offered in recent days by President Bush's former counterterrorism chief, Richard A. Clarke. He has said in a new book that President Bush and his deputies, including Mr. Rumsfeld and Ms. Rice, largely ignored the Qaeda threat in the months before the attacks and left the nation needlessly unprepared.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nThe staff reports and the testimony on Tuesday offered other new details about the government's efforts in recent years to track down Mr. bin Laden and disrupt his terrorist network, including these:\n*In February 1999, the Pentagon drew up plans to fire cruise missiles at a hunting camp in Helmand province in Afghanistan that Mr. bin Laden frequented, but the strike was called off out of fear it could kill an United Arab Emirates prince who could have been with the Qaeda leader or nearby. ''The lead C.I.A. official in the field felt the intelligence reporting in this case was very reliable,'' one of the staff reports said. ''The field official believes today that this was a lost opportunity to kill bin Laden.''\n*In May 1996, Mr. bin Laden and his associates leased an Ariana Airlines jet and flew to Afghanistan from Sudan, stopping in the United Arab Emirates to refuel. A commission staff report said it was unclear whether the Clinton administration had considered intercepting the Qaeda leader.\n*In September 1998, Pentagon counterterrorism officials prepared an eight-page strategy paper that urged a ''more proactive and aggressive'' strategy against Al Qaeda and other terrorist groups. Senior Pentagon officials said the strategy was too aggressive and killed it.\n*In late 2000, Lt. Gen. Gregory Newbold, the director of operations for the military's Joint Staff, prepared a comprehensive plan to use military, economic and political efforts to pressure the Taliban to expel Mr. bin Laden from Afghanistan. Senior military and civilian officials said much of the plan was outside the military's scope and sent it back for more work; it was never acted on.\nIn his testimony, Mr. Rumsfeld told commission members that he considered Al Qaeda a serious threat before Sept. 11, and that he had been taking steps to prepare the military to combat terrorism, steps like revamping the armed forces into a more mobile, lethal force, and ordering commanders worldwide to update their war plans to be more flexible.\nBut the report prepared by the commission staff portrayed Mr. Rumsfeld as a new secretary struggling with delays in getting his senior aides in place and focused on other priorities, like missile defenses.\nMr. Rumsfeld, for instance, never received a briefing from the Pentagon's departing senior counterterrorism expert, the report noted, and counterterrorism aides said ''the new team was focused on other issues and was not especially interested in their counterterrorism agenda.''\nIn interviews with commission staff members, Mr. Rumsfeld ''did not recall any particular counterterrorism issue that engaged his attention before 9/11,'' the report said.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nA pivotal decision the Bush administration inherited from the Clinton administration in January 2001 was whether to provide secret military assistance to the Northern Alliance in a last-ditch effort to stave off its defeat by the Taliban.\nIn March 2001, the counterterrorism staff of the National Security Council, led by Mr. Clarke, pushed for quick approval of the aid, relatively small amounts meant to block the advance of Taliban and Qaeda fighters.\nBut Ms. Rice, the national security adviser, and other top National Security Council aides opposed helping the Northern Alliance alone, arguing that the administration needed a broader strategy to include Pashtun opponents of the Taliban government, the report said. Mr. Clarke warned that delay could imperil the Northern Alliance fighters.\nInstead, an interagency review process, headed by top national security deputies, worked through the summer to produce a National Security Presidential Directive that was ready by Sept. 4 for Mr. Bush's approval.\nThe strategy had three parts that administration officials said could take three years to carry out.\nFirst, it called for a final diplomatic effort to force the Taliban government to give up Mr. bin Laden. If that failed, the administration planned to support a covert action to arm anti-Taliban tribes in Afghanistan and urge them to attack Qaeda bases. If those two steps failed, the administration would use American forces, including ground troops, to overthrow.\nBy the end of 2001, American troops and their allies had swept the Taliban out of Kabul.THREATS AND RESPONSES: THE OVERVIEW; Bush and Clinton Aides Grilled by Panel", "Grits, particles of ground corn that are staple of Southern fare, have been discovered in last ten years by top chefs elsewhere, especially rare varieties used by Glenn Roberts and his company Anson Mills; flavors are heady combination of corn with floral edge; profile of Roberts and company; recipe; mail order information; photos (M)The flavors swirling around a bowl of Anson Mills grits are heady, with sweet, roasted and cream corn flavors and a fine edge of something green and floral.\n''Anson Mills grits are unparalleled,'' said Mr. Trotter, who pairs the humble grains and their resplendent ''complex nutty-corn flavor'' with all manner of fish, meat and game. They are on his menu every evening.\nBut how did those grits end up in Chicago in the first place? It has been, for Mr. Roberts, an odyssey of scholarship and sweat.\nMr. Roberts, 56, studied music and German literature at the University of North Carolina. But his overarching interests aligned themselves in the study of architectural history and the history of food.\n''Food is central to the culture of the South,'' he said. Over the course of a 22-year career as a historic architecture restoration consultant, Mr. Roberts was often asked at the completion of projects to come up with authentic menus reflecting the architectural period. But only rarely could he find the ingredients he needed.\nIn the half-century since his mother grew up in Aiken, S.C., many ingredients that informed the character of regional cookery, known historically as the Carolina Rice Kitchen, were no longer available.\nMr. Roberts studied records of pre-Civil War agriculture and cooking literature, discovering accounts of corn varieties that had apparently passed into extinction.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n''I vowed I would find or restore the quality ingredients of the Carolina Rice Kitchen and make them available,'' he said. So in 1998, he tossed out his business cards, donated his suits to charity, rented his 6,000-square-foot warehouse and bought four granite mills.\nAmong the missing heirlooms were dozens of varieties of antebellum sweet mill corn which was bred to ripen and dry in the field. These varieties possessed superior flavor and qualities suited for making grits or corn meal (ground corn products of different gauge).\nConsidered too labor-intensive for modern agriculture, once-honored varieties -- Carolina Gourdseed White, John Haulk Yellow, Burris White and Boone County White, among others -- had disappeared into the woods with families engaged in the bootleg whiskey trade.\nMr. Roberts went after them.\nWhat he was looking for, specifically, was classic Southern dent corn, so-called because of the dent on top of each kernel. Naturally soft, dent corn is perfect for grinding into corn mash for whiskey -- and perfect for grits.\nMr. Roberts set out to find small mills in the woods that ground the bootleggers' seed. He found the seed, but his first crop, 30 acres, blew down in an August thunderstorm. His crop the following year, however, was magnificent.\n''I started sharing grits from that corn with chefs in the Carolinas and Georgia,'' he said. ''Everyone was knocked out by the flavor.'' He set an additional eight heirloom varieties into the ground in 2000.\n''Great corn is like great wine,'' he said. ''It gets its flavor from the flavor of the earth.''\nBut heirloom corn needs more than good soil. Unlike high-yield commodity hybrids, bred to tolerate close quarters in the field, heirloom corn requires 18 inches of separation between plants. Yet it craves community: corn planted in groups of 100 or less does not pollinate properly and will ultimately die. Heirloom corn also ripens unevenly, so it must be harvested by hand.\nUntil the late 19th century, Southern farmers regularly took their corn to local millers. But by 1950, big roller mills had flattened the little stone mills (corn varieties themselves had long since succumbed to hybrids grown for shelf stability), and the era of uniform-size, flavorless grits and corn meal was off and running.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nIn the 1970's and 80's, efforts to preserve old mills brought artisanal whole grain milling back into public consciousness. But stone milling alone offered no solution: stone mills can damage corn flavor with high milling temperatures.\nMr. Roberts scoured additional historic documents and found a description of an 1850 yellow dent corn variety from Ohio that was milled frozen. This prompted him to freeze his own Carolina Gourdseed before milling it. The ensuing flavor was startling, so he began freezing all his mill corn.\nStone milling -- what Mr. Roberts calls two rocks and some grain -- is not rocket science. Much of the flavor development work takes place in the sifters after the grain is milled. Anson Mills uses combinations of screens to produce products of various consistencies and flavors.\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Anson Mills grits, milled from one-sixth of an inch to one-26th of an inch in diameter, are the coarsest grits produced in this country. They contain pieces of whole germ, which is responsible for 90 percent of the flavor in fresh grits. The large and uneven particles are crucial. (When corn is finely milled, the germ explodes into dust.)\nAnson Mills grits taste best when cooked slowly, so starches are released throughout the cooking process.\n''Grits should not be gritty,'' Mr. Roberts said. ''Ours come packaged with instructions. But busy chefs don't always read the collaterals. They call me and say, 'These grits taste great, but the texture is horrible.' So I walk them through the cooking process -- they're at the stove, phone in one hand, spoon in another.''\nBob Kinkead, the chef of Kinkead's in Washington, considers the beauty of grits ''their ability to soak up massive quantities of butter.'' He added, ''Anson Mills grits do that better than any others.''\nAt Rialto in Cambridge, Mass., Jody Adams uses Anson Mills grits and polenta. ''It is inspiring to find grains that haven't had the life ground out of them,'' she said.\nAnson Mills has provided grants to farmers to resuscitate a dozen varieties of rare or endangered sweet mill corn. The company also shares its expertise in research, management advice and seed selection with growers who plant small plots of heirloom seed.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nAnson Mills has in addition taken on research and production of organic heirloom wheat and Carolina gold rice.\nMr. Roberts said the work will be worth it if it offers future generations of Southerners a good, steady taste of the past.\nAmericana In Your Bowl\nANSON MILLS stone-ground grits (white or yellow) are sold by mail directly from the mill.

In the 1,000-odd years that halvah has been written about, recipes for it have included a chewy confection of dried fruit and nuts, a milky pudding of buttered semolina and even a soft, cooked cream made from fresh cheese and sugar, eaten with a spoon. These types of halvah still exist in the Middle East and in Greece.\nIn Lebanon, where Ghassan Matli, the halvah maker and manager at Damascus Bakery on Atlantic Avenue in Brooklyn, grew up, halvah is served as a snack or part of a meal. Mr. Matli likes his crumbled and rolled up into pita bread with bananas. ''It's good for breakfast because it makes you strong,'' Mr. Matli said.\nAt Damascus, he makes his halvah alone, and always under cover of night. ''The recipe is a secret, but I can tell you we use the best sesame seeds, from Guatemala, and not too much sugar,'' he said. ''Many people add too much sugar because sugar is cheaper than sesame. But when it's too sweet, it's no good.''\nHis recipe, slightly smoother and silkier than many others, is just sweet enough. He makes 300 pounds of it a week most of the year, but up to 50 percent more in spring, when demand is at its peak. This is when Sephardic Jews seek it out for Passover (Ashkenazic Jews do not consider halvah kosher for Passover) and Greeks seek it for Lent. Mr. Zapantis, of Thalassa, said, ''Everyone has halvah during Lent because it has no dairy or eggs.''\nLast year, he put halvah in ice cream; this year, crepes. ''I guess when you're in your 20's you experiment with all kinds of new ingredients,'' he said. ''Now I'm 41, and I'm rediscovering my roots.''\nAlthough halvah is not exactly part of Mr. Yosses' roots, it still evokes his childhood in Toledo, Ohio. ''There is a big Lebanese community in Toledo, and we could always find halvah bars in the candy store,'' he said. ''To me it was the Lebanese equivalent of a Milky Way. I love its gritty, crunchy, sticky texture, the way it gets stuck in your teeth. It must be a dentist's nightmare.''\nIt is that particular layered, almost glassy-sandy texture, which reminds me of cotton candy, that makes halvah so irresistible to its fans. Achieving that texture is no easy feat, even for a professional.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nThe secret is careful, measured mixing by hand, said Richard Radutzky of Joyva Corporation in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, the largest halvah producer in the country. ''We make at least 20,000 pounds of halvah every week, and all of it is mixed by hand,'' he said. ''We tried to build a machine to do it, but we couldn't get it right. Most machines mix it too much, which makes it too smooth. But then if you don't mix it enough, it's too rough, and it will fall apart. You are looking to get that perfect flaky texture.''\nThe halvah (all kosher) is mixed in large, bowl-shaped copper kettles by big, burly men, who alternately paddle, stir and knead a mixture of egg whites, sugar syrup and tahini (sesame paste). Flavorings, like melted chocolate for the marble halvah or pistachio nuts, are added at the end.\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

''Then my father and his brothers added pistachios and marble. The newest flavor we added was 20 years ago, chocolate-covered halvah with almonds. When you have three and four generations in one company, you take baby steps. Change is slow.''\nMr. Radutzky, along with his cousin Sandy Wiener, would like to create newer flavors to entice younger customers. ''We've been tossing around things like cookie dough, cappuccino and cherry, but it's tricky because we don't want to alienate our regular customers either,'' he said. ''People are very passionate about halvah. They really go nuts. We need to think about it, so it may not end up happening for yet another generation.''\nThat means the world is safe from cookie dough halvah, for, oh, at least 20 years more.\nFLOURLESS CHOCOLATE CAKE WITH HALVAH HONEY SAUCE\nTime: 45 minutes\nButter and flour for pan\n1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter\n8 ounces bittersweet chocolate, chopped\n1 tablespoon brandy or rum\n6 large eggs, separated\n1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons sugar\nPinch of salt\nHalvah honey sauce for serving (see recipe).\n1.

The new rules make sentencing for financial crimes more mechanical, limiting judges' discretion.\nMuch as the amount of narcotics involved helps dictate the sentence for federal drug crimes, the prison terms for financial crimes now are tied to the amount of money investors lost. In Mr. Olis's case, probation officials who wrote the sentencing recommendation estimated Dynegy's losses at more than $100 million.\n''If we want corporate corruption to be today's crack cocaine, then this is what we get,'' said Michael Goldsmith, a law professor at Brigham Young University who served on the United States Sentencing Commission during the Clinton administration.\nThe $100 million estimate, however, is part of the entire decline in Dynegy's stock, which traded for as much as $56.99 a share in April 2001 before falling as low as 86 cents in August 2002. Mr. Olis's lawyers have argued that his actions were not the only reason for that decline, which occurred during one of the worst overall market slumps in decades. Dynegy shares closed at $3.52 Tuesday.\nLawyers, prosecutors and defendants involved in white-collar cases throughout the country have closely followed the sentencing of Mr. Olis since details of his potential prison term, which are usually kept secret, were revealed in court filings by his lawyers this month. A person involved in the defense strategy for Mr. Olis said he was ''bracing for the worst.''\nMr. Skilling, the former Enron executive, and other prominent defendants in high-profile white-collar federal cases, like John J. Rigas, the founder and former chairman of Adelphia, could also face lengthy sentences if they are convicted.\nIf Sim Lake, the federal judge overseeing Mr. Olis's case, agrees with the sentencing recommendation of probation officers, it would be the most severe prison term for a business crime in recent memory, several sentencing experts said.\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Fastow, a former chief financial officer at Enron, after he admitted to working with other senior officers to disguise the company's financial health. Martha Stewart, convicted of lying this month to federal investigators in connection with a 2001 stock trade, faces a sentence of 10 to 16 months since her crimes were not as serious as securities fraud under the sentencing guidelines.\nUnder the old sentencing guidelines, someone convicted of securities fraud resulting in losses totaling more than $100 million could be sentenced to a term of 6 to 7 years in prison, far less than the 24 to 35 years under the new guidelines.\nAfter the Enron collapse and other corporate scandals, potential sentences have become more severe. Someone who is convicted of securities fraud that costs investors in a public company more than $400 million in losses can face 30 years to life in prison, according to the sentencing guidelines adopted last year.\nFederal sentencing guidelines have been raised further since Mr. Olis committed his crime; a law passed last July and named for its sponsors -- Senator Paul S. Sarbanes, Democrat of Maryland, and Representative Michael G. Oxley, Republican of Ohio -- called for sentences of up to 20 years for top executives who knowingly or willfully publish misleading financial statements.\nMr. Olis, who never rose above a position of vice president for finance at Dynegy after serving as the senior director of tax planning, could not be reached for comment. Unlike other defendants in high-profile securities fraud cases, Mr. Olis never amassed a fortune from his time at Dynegy when he helped devise the scheme, known as Project Alpha.\nAccording to court records, the most money he made at Dynegy was in 2001 when he received a salary of $162,000 and a bonus of $110,000, in addition to selling Dynegy stock worth about $200,000. By comparison, Mr. Skilling, the former chief executive at Enron, paid his lawyers $23 million before a federal judge froze about $55 million of his assets this year.\nThe two other Dynegy officials convicted of taking part in the scheme -- Gene S. Foster, Mr. Olis's ex-boss and a former vice president for taxation, and Helen C. Sharkey, a former member of Dynegy's risk control and deal structure groups -- struck plea deals giving them maximum sentences of five years.\nMr. Olis's lawyers are seeking a sentence of 5 to 10 years, arguing both that he is not responsible for all losses at Dynegy but also that he has no previous criminal record.\nThe main factor is whether Judge Lake accepts probation officials' analysis of investors' losses. Under the sentencing guidelines, a lesser loss would require a lighter sentence.Stiff Sentence Is Possibility For a Name Not So Known", "Lynda Richardson Public Lives column discusses Brooklyn College black literature and Haitian studies Professor Regine Latortue, whose cousin Gerard is new prime minister of Haiti; photo (M)Ms. Latortue sighs heavily, contemplating the job her cousin faces.

That's the fact, and quite definitely, only we can get ourselves out of it.'' She feels a deep patriotism about her birthplace, something she says is reflected in the literature of the country. Her family fled Haiti when she was 12 during the dictatorship of Fran\u00e7ois Duvalier, known as Papa Doc.

He is her father's first cousin. She describes Prime Minister Latortue as warm, the sort of man who makes people feel comfortable. ''I have never met anyone at all who doesn't like him,'' she says. ''He is just a positive person.''\nMS. LATORTUE, who is divorced with no children, does not see herself as a community leader, at least in any active sense, in Brooklyn's large Haitian population.

Next month, she will become the president of the College Language Association, a national academic group founded by black scholars that focuses on English, literature and foreign languages. She is also the coordinator of a bilingual education technical center at Brooklyn College, which helps public school teachers with students whose first language is Creole.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nLiterature has been Ms. Latortue's passion since childhood, and she excelled in school.

For the last three years, there has been no real process for resolving it: the road map to peace exists on paper, but not in reality. And so the conflict grinds on, with victims mounting on both sides.\nFor the short term, Sheik Yassin's killing on Monday in Gaza is almost certain to foster retaliation by those eager to have Israelis suffer pain as well. Already yesterday, the Israeli military said it foiled a rocket attack on Israel by militants in southern Lebanon, killing two of the militants in an air strike. Yet for the long term, the fact remains that most Palestinians prefer coexistence and not perpetual struggle and did not see Sheik Yassin and Hamas as offering an acceptable pathway to the future.\nIt's no secret that Israeli military officials are concerned about the dangers of having it appear as if Hamas violence is the reason for Israel's planned military withdrawal from Gaza. (That, of course, may account for the increased impulse to go after Hamas and its leaders in Gaza.) What is more remarkable is that every Palestinian I spoke with during a recent visit to the Middle East agreed, believing that Hamas would gain psychologically and practically from an Israeli withdrawal.\nOne would think that this shared concern would make it possible for the two sides to find common ground and coordinate the Israeli withdrawal in a way that would benefit Palestinians. Perhaps, if Prime Minister Ariel Sharon of Israel and the Palestinian prime minister, Ahmed Qurei, ever hold their long-delayed meeting, such a process could begin. But even before the killing of Sheik Yassin, it was hard to be optimistic about the two men reaching a workable agreement.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nThe Israelis are convinced that Mr. Qurei is powerless; that the leader of the Palestinian Authority, Yasir Arafat, prevents him from doing anything; and that Mr. Arafat prefers chaos to stability. Unless Mr. Qurei can show Mr. Sharon that he has a plan for security and that he is poised to act on it, the Israelis will continue on their chosen path of unilateral withdrawal from Gaza and the completion of a security barrier in the West Bank.Withdrawal Without Reward", "Michael Winerip On Education column discusses former New York City Panel for Educational Policy member Susana Torruella Leval; Leval was fired with two other members for disagreeing with Mayor Michael R Bloomberg's mandatory retention proposal, but says she still respects mayor immensely; also warns that panel's efficacy was hindered by hasty voting schedule and poor communication between mayor and panel members; drawing (M)Ms. Leval says this caught her off guard (''I thought, 'Geeps, this is not nice.''') but standing in the TV lights' glare, she decided to go along. ''One of the negative things about the Board of Education under the old system was the tremendous amount of public infighting,'' she says. ''So for a year and a half we were a completely invisible panel. Nobody talked to the press.''\nIn the last week, of course, the invisible panel has become what may be America's most visible education panel. When the mayor couldn't get Ms. Leval and two other members to agree with his proposal on mandatory retention, he fired them, had three new members appointed and rammed his policy home -- in one workday.\nNow, once again enjoying her free-speech rights, Ms. Leval says she still admires the mayor and the chancellor, Joel I. Klein; still believes they are ''brilliant'' men who care about making the schools better; and still believes in mayoral control of the schools.\nBut she also believes they are squandering an unprecedented opportunity because they are moving too fast and failing to work with the people they need to execute their policies -- teachers, principals, their own regional managers and parents. ''If the culture that's receiving all this change so fast can't absorb it, I don't see how it can be implemented,'' says Ms. Leval.\nShe believes that both the mayor, as a businessman, and the chancellor, as a longtime prosecutor, are good at giving orders but bad at accepting constructive criticism. ''Every month we'd be presented a major new policy -- bilingual ed, special ed, regional reorganization, standardized curriculum, the new capital plan, No Child Left Behind transfers, social promotion,'' she says. ''They'd give us these brief PowerPoint presentations. We needed time to understand the issues.''\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter.

''We heard about the new standardized curriculum in a Jan. 21, 2003, release. We had to vote Feb. 10. These are complex issues.''\nAfter complaining to the chancellor, the panel received more detailed briefings, but she says, the pace was still dizzying. ''I've saved a big fat file full of e-mail protests from panelists about the same thing -- we need more time to learn.''\n''On April 3, 2003, we got a press release about reforming special ed,'' says Ms. Leval. ''April 8, we got a memo with some specifics. April 14 we approved it. That's a huge issue -- 11 days. When I look back, I'm embarrassed.''\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nAH, special education. Last month I wrote two columns on the chancellor's special education reorganization -- quoting teachers, principals, regional officials and parents -- saying they had never seen the system in such disarray. When I sought comment from the city's top special education official, Linda Wernikoff, she denied this, insisting she had not heard complaints from her regional managers, ''and I meet with them regularly.'' Then, last week, the new deputy chancellor, Carmen Fari\u00f1a, sent a memo to regional managers, citing these very problems and the need ''to be doing a far better job.''\nWas Ms. Wernikoff misleading me? Or was she speaking the truth -- that her subordinates were not telling her about the problems they were so willing to tell a reporter?\nMs. Leval, booted for disagreeing with the mayor once in 18 months, fears the latter: that this administration has created an atmosphere where subordinates are not willing to speak truth to those in power. ''This is a managerial culture not comfortable with true listening,'' she says.\nShe learned of the mayor's mandatory retention policy when everyone else did -- from his Jan. 8 State of the City Address. She says that as an arts person, she had no firm opinion, and spent two months ''reading like a maniac on the issue,'' deciding in the end that his plan relied too much on a standardized test and needed a more flexible appeals process. As the voted neared, she spoke to the mayor. ''I told him with one more month I think we could come up with an acceptable compromise. He said, 'No, no, no, it has to be voted on now.'''\nRobert Lawson, a city spokesman, said the mayor appreciated Ms. Leval's service. ''Just because there are differences of opinion, that does not mean that a variety of voices have not been heard and input taken into account or even used to shape policy,'' he said.\nMs. Leval does not see enough of it.\n''Do they listen?'' she says. ''Anyone can listen. To me you have to listen with an ear that's open.''ON EDUCATION; Fired for Disagreeing, Ex-Panelist Fears the Mayor Is Discouraging Advice He Needs to Hear", "Elvis Mitchell reviews movie Everyday People, directed by Jim McKay, which will open annual New Directors/New Films series presented by Museum of Modern Art and Lincoln Center; photo (M)''Everyday People,'' an ensemble drama written and directed by Jim McKay, has a roaming, lived-in quality, a lovely and enlightening simplicity. It is Mr. McKay's latest film to depict New York City and its boroughs as a delicate series of ecosystems, and it will open the annual New Directors/New Films series tonight, presented by the Museum of Modern Art and Lincoln Center.\nMr. McKay creates an electron-microscope amplification of what appears from a distance to be a huge, unfeeling metropolis. The organisms that keep the neighborhoods functioning often collide, most conspicuously when their livelihoods are at stake. Mr. McKay and a talented, agile cast expose the drama of that situation.\n''Everyday People'' is full of raw nerve endings and hurt feelings; Mr. McKay's abilities include the combustible anguish of anger and pride. That unstable mixture is the overspill of this movie's story: Raskin's, a long-lived Brooklyn restaurant and neighborhood mainstay, is going out of business after being sold to developers, and the film charts the lives of those who work at and around the place.\nThe picture has the thriving, constant cross-chatter that makes the chorus of the Sly Stone song that gave the film its title, as well as the racial tensions that Mr. Stone sang about and that still course through this country nearly 40 years later. One of the best scenes, delivering resentment, shock and denial, comes when news of the closing is dropped to the waiters by the gentle but firm manager, Arthur (Stephen McKinley Henderson, all chary dignity). The owner, Ira (Jordan Gelber), wasn't man enough to do the job himself, and the employee meeting boils up in a hurry.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nThe hostility over their status is just another ingredient in the drama, and all the actors -- some have only this one scene to shine in -- demand to take up the space they're owed on screen. It's where Mr. McKay's skill in using large casts is at its peak, and his love of actors feeling their way through the material is conveyed with a ragged charm. His affection is affecting and infectious.FILM FESTIVAL REVIEW; Elegy for a Local Restaurant", "New pocket book Dim Sum, A Pocket Guide describes 50 popular items diners might encounter in dim sum restaurant; photo (S)Ordering dim sum is usually a pick and point operation, transcending any language barrier, as carts of foods roll by.

Pentagon officials declined to provide a precise figure for how much business BondCote has done with the military, beyond saying it provides more than 70 percent of the camouflage fabrics used by subcontractors.\nThe discovery and investigation of the material began after a Virginia resident, Keith Ayers, filed a citizen's complaint 14 months ago against BondCote charging that it was secretly using lead chromate to lower its costs in providing camouflage fabrics to meet military specifications. Most of the filings in the suit have been sealed by the court.\nThe suit by Mr. Ayers, who had a business dispute with BondCote, was brought using the federal False Claims Act, a law that allows private citizens to sue contractors for defrauding the government. Under the law, sometimes known as the whistle-blower's act, an individual can sue on behalf of the government and, if successful, can be rewarded with a percentage of any settlement.\nThe law also allows the government to assume control of the lawsuit; that is what happened in the BondCote case. Mr. Ayers and his lawyers are challenging the $1.7 million figure as far too small.\n''This was a massive fraud on the military, with the potential for serious illness,'' said Mike Bothwell, the Georgia lawyer who helped Mr. Ayers bring his lawsuit and who first contacted The Times about the issue.\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Thompson, who represents BondCote, said in an interview that the company's annual revenues were about $30 million, with coated fabrics accounting for only part of that. The size of the settlement was reasonable, Mr. Thompson said, because BondCote is a small company with fewer than 140 employees.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nThe fabrics come in green camouflage and tan camouflage. The lead chromate is used to help the product meet requirements for flexibility and visibility to infrared light.\nIn a brief statement, Ted Anderson, the president of BondCote, said that extensive testing demonstrated conclusively that the fabric was safe.\n''There is simply no truth to the baseless suggestions that the material poses any risk,'' he said.\nIn a letter to Mr. Ayers in January 2003, Mr. Anderson asserted that BondCote had not used lead chromate. The company apparently dropped that position after a May 2003 raid on its warehouse by federal agents. The company now says that the chemicals did not pose any threat and that it no longer uses them.\nA Pentagon official said that procurement officials said that BondCote had acted improperly, but that there was no real harm done because the tests showed no risk.\nAccording to a Sept. 30, 2003, report by an Army research agency, tests on 20 ''lightly worn'' tents over three months showed ''low-level hexavalent chromium,'' a byproduct of lead chromate degradation, but at amounts far lower than would cause concern for troops living and working in them during a full year.\nA report by a toxicologist hired by Mr. Bothwell said the government report was flawed because only lightly worn tents were tested.Military Was Sold Lead-Tainted Fabric for Tents, but Pentagon Says There Was No Risk", "Editorial contends that Haiti's newly appointed prime minister, Gerard Latortue, has gone out of his way to embrace some of unsavory thugs who helped oust contry's last elected president, Jean-Bertrand Aristide; asserts that successive Haitian governments have compromised their own legitimacy by using criminal gangs as enforcersHaiti, torn by weeks of unrest and decades of misgovernment, badly needs its newly appointed prime minister, G\u00e9rard Latortue, to succeed. Yet Mr. Latortue did himself no favors on Saturday by going out of his way to embrace some of the unsavory thugs who helped oust the country's last elected president, Jean-Bertrand Aristide. Successive Haitian governments have compromised their own legitimacy by using criminal gangs as enforcers. Mr. Latortue needs to end this disastrous pattern, not perpetuate it.\nMr. Latortue has no democratic mandate. Haitians are bitterly split between Aristide supporters and opponents, and both sides are heavily armed. Clearly, he needs to reach out to those on both sides of this divide who want to move their country forward. But Mr. Latortue aided neither national reconciliation nor his own shaky legitimacy by the unseemly ceremony he took part in last Saturday.\nFerried by American military helicopters to the city of Gona\u00efves, where the anti-Aristide revolt began, he stood on a stage with killers like Jean-Pierre Baptiste. Mr. Baptiste, who escaped from prison in 2002, is a death squad leader convicted of participating in a 1994 massacre of Aristide supporters.\nAlso welcoming Mr. Latortue to Gona\u00efves was Guy Philippe, the rebel military chief, who has yet to keep his promise to American commanders to disarm his fighters. While there, the prime minister unwisely paid tribute to Amiot M\u00e9tayer, the murdered founder of the Cannibal Army, an initially pro-Aristide gang. In 2002, Mr. M\u00e9tayer was jailed at the behest of the Organization of American States. Freed by his supporters the next month, he turned against President Aristide and was later murdered. Mr. M\u00e9tayer's followers began the revolt that toppled the elected government.\nUntil Haiti can hold fair elections, Mr. Latortue derives his authority from the American-led occupation force. His mistakes damage not just his reputation, but Washington's as well.A Shameful Show in Haiti", "Michael Carroll, 20, who won $18-million British lottery jackpot, is ordered to undergo counseling after conviction for drug possession; photo; Carroll, called 'Lotto Lout' by tabloid newspapers, has long history of disorderly conduct (S)A 20-year-old man who won an $18 million lottery jackpot but was later convicted of possessing cocaine, marijuana and psychedelic mushrooms was ordered to undergo counselling and drug testing.

Indeed, Mr. Silver still seemed to be smarting from the attacks last week, and often couched his words Tuesday in very personal terms.\n''A great deal of rhetoric has been swirling around the Capitol on the issue of terrorism,'' Mr. Silver said during a news conference.\n''No one can lecture me about the price of terrorism,'' said Mr. Silver, who represents Lower Manhattan. ''I felt the ground beneath my feet shake when the towers came down.''\nAs if the debate did not have enough divisive elements already, race was injected into the matter last week. The Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, discussing why he thought the Assembly had failed to act on terrorism legislation, said the Democrats were historically opposed to increasing penalties because they felt members of the black and Hispanic communities would be disproportionately affected.\nThe words have reverberated in the Capitol all week, and on Tuesday, Assemblyman Adriano Espaillat, a Democrat from the Bronx and leader of the Black, Puerto Rican and Hispanic Legislative Caucus, again called for an apology, adding, ''We do not need instructions from him on patriotism.''\nJohn McArdle, a spokesman for Mr. Bruno, said, ''There is nothing to apologize for.''\nMr. Silver, in announcing the measures, said the Assembly had been studying the issues for the past year and had held a number of public hearings to try to figure out the best approach.

Indeed, on Tuesday morning, before Mr. Silver made his proposal, Mr. Pataki pointed again to overseas events as a reason to pass his new antiterrorism laws. ''We just saw yesterday and today where Hamas is now saying that for the first time they are urging people to launch attacks against Americans,'' he said.\nMr. Pataki said the highlights of his antiterrorism package included tougher laws on money laundering, allowing local law enforcement officials to follow the federal lead and use roving wiretaps, ending the statute of limitations on terrorist crimes, and ''making it a crime to possess or use or threaten with weapons of mass destruction, whether it is chemical or biological.''\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nWith the exception of changing the wiretap law, Mr. Silver's proposal addresses all of the issues listed by Mr. Pataki. But since the bills that would provide the details have yet to be written, Republican leaders in the Senate were hesitant to respond.\nMr. Pataki, however, issued a statement through an aide, Lynn Rasic, saying the speaker's proposal ''fails to include the strong provisions that are contained'' in his own proposal.\n''While it is encouraging that the Assembly has finally joined the discussion, we are afraid that upon reviewing their legislation, we will find that it is too little too late,'' the statement said.\nComplicating the politics, Mr. Pataki's package has the support of Eliot Spitzer, the Democratic attorney general. Mr. Spitzer, who is considering a run for governor in 2006, has mostly remained behind the scenes in the debate. His office said that as a prosecutor, he was naturally supportive of laws increasing the power of law enforcement officials. Therefore, the governor's proposals remain the package he supports. But, walking a fine line, he also encouraged the Assembly package.\n''It's imperative now that both houses sit down with the governor to negotiate a joint terrorism bill that can be enacted this session,'' said Darren Dopp, a spokesman for Mr. Spitzer.\nBut in the current cantankerous environment, that may be hard to do.\nSenator Eric T. Schneiderman, a Democrat from Manhattan who voted against the governor's package, which was passed by the Senate last week, said the real problem was that politicians on both sides of the aisle were using the issue to pander to their bases and push through legislation that was only marginally related to terrorism, if at all.\nHe said that if much of the chaff were stripped from the legislation in both houses, there would still be a core of issues that most people agree are important and that can have an impact on preventing future terror acts. These include money laundering laws, new cyberterrorism laws and even expanded wiretap laws.\nSenator Michael A.L. Balboni, a Republican from Long Island who has pushed the governor's terrorism package, also said he believed there was common ground. However, he said, he was not sure if Mr. Silver's move Tuesday signaled that he now has a partner across the aisle or whether this is simply a political move by Mr. Silver.Silver Offers Antiterror Plan As Feud With Pataki Grows", "Media Empire Receives More Than a Dozen Bids More than a dozen bidders, including the Barclay brothers of Britain, submitted preliminary offers for all or parts of Conrad M.

And these days, he does a lot of it.\nDuring one week in early March, while the Philharmonic was performing his ''Pied Piper Fantasy'' (written for James Galway, the flutist), Mr. Corigliano taught composition classes at Lehman, attended auditions for composing students at Juilliard, lectured aspiring composers at New York University and spent two mornings with a high school band and orchestra in Carmel, N.Y.\nHe says the down-to-earth feeling at Lehman, where he is now a distinguished professor, has kept him there, even though he has been approached about moving to schools like Yale and Juilliard.\nHe said he finds the Lehman faculty congenial and likes the range of students. Some have made their living as musicians, playing in wedding bands or composing jingles for commercials. Others are relative newcomers.\n''A lot of them have never composed before,'' Mr. Corigliano said. ''Then they do it. It is so joyful.''\nJeffrey Layton, a professional composer and musician who enrolled at Lehman College to study with Mr. Corigliano, said that at first it was intimidating to study with such a master, but that it has worked out well.\n''He's opened up my mind,'' Mr. Layton said.\nDespite the wide range of students, Mr. Layton said, Mr. Corigliano was able to help all of them. ''It's almost like a one-room schoolhouse,'' he added.\nThe enthusiasm was evident in Mr. Corigliano's composition class at Lehman this week.\nThe sunny classroom was cramped and a bit scuffed.

At one point, he played a recording of a piece he wrote for two pianos tuned a quarter-tone apart. (''It's very hard for a tuner,'' he warned.) And he conducted a short piece by a student in the class.\nThe 19 students listened attentively to them all.\n''I was familiar with most of the forms, but a couple I hadn't heard before,'' said Hector Marin, a 26-year-old student from Costa Rica who is registered at City College but travels to Lehman for Mr. Corigliano's class.\nThe last few weeks have been given over to performing students' 12-tone compositions. Monday's piece, by Paul Lee, was rhythmic and intense. After several false starts, the students played it through smoothly.\nAt one point, Mr. Corigliano asked Mr. Lee, ''Is that the right tempo?''\n''No,'' Mr. Lee said. ''A little faster.''\nMr. Corigliano looked surprised.\n''Faster?'' he said. ''O.K.''\nThe students swayed in their seats. Their feet tapped. One woman conducted along with Mr. Corigliano.

But he said later that hearing real instruments play his work gave him a big adrenalin rush.\n''Nothing I've ever experienced before compares to what hearing my music does,'' he said.\nThen Mr. Corigliano moved on to other musical forms. He played music from India, with a 22-note scale and no harmony. (''It sounds strange,'' he said, ''but I think it is very beautiful.'')

''I watch television. I call my friends and ask, 'If I don't finish this piece, will you still love me?'''\nAnd that, too, is part of the reason he keeps teaching, he says. For a few hours a week, it is an escape from the tension of composing.\n''I tread through very difficult waters when I compose,'' he said after class this week. ''There's something very nurturing about teaching.

Mr. Ellef's lawyer, Hugh Keefe, did not return phone calls. Mr. Claywell's lawyers say that meeting was to discuss a payment problem Mr. Claywell wanted Mr. Ellef to help solve.\nUltimately, the fiscal year that ended June 30, 2001, was a lucrative one for Mr. Claywell, according to the tally provided by the state comptroller's office. He received $1.76 million from the state that year, second only to the $2.59 million he got the next fiscal year.\nMr. Claywell was indicted again by federal prosecutors in April 2003 on tax and insurance charges, and pleaded guilty in May to insurance fraud. In September, he pleaded guilty as well to tax fraud for charging personal expenses to his businesses, which reduced their taxable income.\nAmong the expenses were a speedboat that he listed as generators for the Stamford Courthouse and a $43,578 birthday party for his wife that he described as expenses for the juvenile training center and a conference for employees of the Department of Public Works. To reduce his sentence, he has been cooperating with federal prosecutors who are investigating corruption within the Rowland administration, his lawyers say.\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Twardy Jr., says he has no information about that payment that suggests any impropriety or effort by state officials to placate Mr. Claywell so he might not testify against them or the governor.\n''Do we know if Rowland was saying, let's keep Kurt happy or else he'll squeal?'' Mr. Twardy asked. ''It's nothing I know of.''\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n''It makes no sense to me,'' he said of the expedited handling of the check Mr. Claywell received in December, ''because it was post his being cut off by Rowland.''\nThe auditors' report provides few answers beyond noting that the payment violated proper procedure and was an ''unauthorized expenditure of state funds.''\nThe project manager who sought the $800,000 payment failed to get approval from Commissioner Fleming, the report noted, and failed to elicit a release from Mr. Claywell promising that he would not sue for more later.\nAccording to the report, Mr. Claywell submitted 19 change orders during the Stamford Courthouse project, which cited ''design error'' as the reason he was demanding $1 million beyond the value of the contract he was awarded.\nMr. Fleming said he could not disclose the name of the project manager until his own internal review was complete.Auditors Criticize the State Over Payment to Contractor", "Pittsburgh University point guard Carl Krauser prepares for NCAA tournament Round of 16; photos (M)The Panthers (31-4) will face second-seeded Oklahoma State tomorrow night in East Rutherford, N.J.\nOn Krauser's left arm the words ''Bronx Balla'' are tattooed.

He got into fights, and his father, Mario Krauser, taught him to box.\nKrauser was playing basketball for the Kips Bay Boys and Girls Club when he was noticed by Doc Nicelli, the coach of the Broncos, a prominent Amateur Athletic Union team based in Manhattan.

Every time a mother is unable to pick up her daughter at school, or has to sneak out of work early or ask the baby sitter to vacuum the rug, she is confronting the financial, emotional and moral choices she has made.\nWith three children and a part-time career as a psychologist and author, Ms. de Marneffe is a veteran of such conflicts. Although the convention is that a woman's fulfillment is at odds with her child's needs, the truth, Ms. de Marneffe argues, is the opposite: caregiving is the path to fulfillment. Feminism has championed women's choice, she writes, but it has ignored or denied the desire -- not the duty, not the biological imperative, not the necessity -- but the raw, profound desire to care for one's own children.\nJust talking about such deeply felt urges, she says, is so disdained that women are embarrassed to admit them. ''It is almost as if women's desire for sex and their desire to mother have switched places in terms of taboo.'' This cultural taboo makes it nearly impossible for women to work out a meaningful and satisfactory balance in their lives.\nAt times this well-researched book contains flashes of insight and expressions of deep sympathy, as when Ms. de Marneffe notes that our values inevitably determine what we consider to be needs. She captures the exquisite conflicts that weigh on women, and despite occasional lapses into self-helpese she writes movingly of the transfiguring effect of motherhood.\nYet alongside nuanced analyses are familiar caricatures and overstatements. Mainstream feminism in this book resembles a Size 4 sweater after it has been put on a Size 16 body: so stretched to fit the argument that it is barely recognizable. I can't think of anyone who considers that asking if we're ignoring maternal desire is, as Ms. de Marneffe says, ''tantamount to claiming that women are only happy if they are barefoot and pregnant.'' Many of the feminist tracts she cites are a dozen years old or more. And the supermom ideal that she says still tyrannizes women hasn't been taken seriously since big shoulder pads were in fashion.\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Really? So I guess that means part of the reason more than 43 million Americans lack health insurance is because they are ambivalent about having coverage.\nIf the joys of motherhood get short shrift in public discussions, perhaps it is because on the crowded agenda of women's needs concerns about day care, re-entering the work force and flexible hours (the social structure that she herself notes would support women ''attempting to combine child rearing with paid work'') are more pressing.\nIn one sense what Ms. de Marneffe wants -- like most everyone else -- is validation. Simply deciding on your own to care for your children full time is not enough. How a mother interprets, say, losing her temper when her kid has a tantrum -- whether it means she should ''get a job,'' get over her ''attachment to recognition in the world'' or ''somehow try to accept the inevitability of conflict'' -- is largely dependent on what society thinks. That is why Ms. de Marneffe wants the culture to recognize the value of mothering through laws, policies and, most important for her purposes, theories of psychological development.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n''We are often anxious for the world to tell us unequivocally what is right,'' she writes, ''especially where our children's care is concerned.''\nYet to understand this desire, the desire for validation, perhaps we would be better off looking at behavioral economics. Feminism has brought American women, particularly middle- and upper-class white ones, enormous freedom to make choices previously closed to them. But more choice does not necessarily mean more happiness. Researchers have found that the combination of increased affluence and endless choice actually makes people more miserable.\nAs Barry Schwartz, who just published ''The Paradox of Choice'' (Ecco, 2004), explains in the April issue of Scientific American the reason is ''opportunity costs.'' ''One of the 'costs' of making a selection is losing the opportunities that different options would have afforded,'' he writes. ''The more alternatives there are, the deeper our sense of loss will be and the less satisfaction we will derive from our ultimate decision.''\nAccompanying women's newfound autonomy is an acute and poignant sense of the paths not taken. Like the buyer who assiduously reads reviews of the car he already bought for confirmation that he made the right choice, mothers scan the news for reassurance; those who leave their kids in day care zero in on studies showing that those children have greater language development, while stay-at-home moms note how children in their mothers' care tend to have fewer behavioral problems.\nEvery choice entails loss as well as gain. That is not just a maternal or professional dilemma. That's life.BOOKS OF THE TIMES; Mothering and Its Cultural Discontents", "Government's warning that people newly taking antidepressants can become suicidal and must be closely monitored grew at least in part from concern that drugs are being handed out too freely and without enough follow-up, especially in children and teenagers; Dr Wayne K Goodman, member of expert panel that advises FDA, says he thinks many physicians, and particularly nonpsychiatrists, have been lulled into notion that these drugs are safe; photo (M)But, she added, ''Untreated depression is dangerous and takes a huge toll on people's lives, and we can only hope this warning doesn't discourage people from seeking treatment.''\nPatients had mixed reactions.\nSome people who suffered depression in the past but shunned medication said the new warnings reinforced their wariness.\nBarry Owen, 51, a magazine consultant in San Francisco, refused antidepressants during an emotional crisis.\nHe said his doctor recommended the drugs a few years ago ''because at that point I was pretty severely depressed and having panic attacks and couldn't eat and sleep.'' Mr. Owen added: ''I decided then not to take her advice. And while I don't doubt the usefulness for a lot of people, this new information gives me one more question about them.''\nBut patients who have done well on the drugs were not troubled by the new warnings. Paul Festa, 33, a San Francisco artist and writer, took Zoloft for about a year in 1999, and then Paxil for a year or so after the 2001 terrorist attacks. He said: ''I would never hesitate to go back on these medications because I already know that I react extremely well to them. I feel like there should be a warning for people who are depressed that not taking these medications could lead to suicide. If you're depressed, you're putting yourself at risk for all sorts of self-destructive behaviors, up to and including suicide.\n''When I was depressed, the thought of suicide was crossing my mind more than it ought to have, and the antidepressants got me out of that loop.''\nThe advisory issued Monday by the drug agency asked manufacturers to put detailed warnings about a possible increased risk of suicidal behavior and the need for monitoring on the labels of 10 antidepressants: Prozac, Zoloft, Paxil, Wellbutrin, Luvox, Celexa, Lexapro, Effexor, Serzone and Remeron. The warning included both children and adults.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nStudies in children taking the antidepressants have not found an increase in suicide. But studies of some drugs have suggested that they might increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Research has also failed to provide convincing evidence that the drugs are effective in children, making the potential risks even less acceptable. There is no solid data linking use of the drugs to suicide in adults.\nDr. Goodman of Florida said that panelists who met last month were troubled by reports that some doctors were giving patients samples of antidepressants and saying casually ''Tell me how you do,'' rather than scheduling frequent follow-up appointments to make sure patients were tolerating the drugs.\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Prozac, Paxil and other modern antidepressants became hugely popular in part because drug companies convinced family physicians that they were safe enough to use without a psychiatrist's intervention. Antidepressants are the third biggest selling category of drugs in the world behind cholesterol and heartburn pills.\nSome psychiatrists speculated yesterday that their family-care colleagues might lose confidence in the drugs and become reluctant to prescribe them.\n''We're hoping that doesn't happen, because primary care physicians have a major role to play in combating depression,'' said Dr. James H. Scully Jr., medical director of the American Psychiatric Association. ''We hope they won't be scared off.''\nDr. Robert Lee, a San Francisco physician of holistic medicine who sometimes prescribes antidepressants, said: ''I don't think people already taking them will be concerned. But a lot of people who I think would benefit from these meds already won't take them because of various stigma reasons, so I'm a little concerned that this will raise that barrier even higher.''\nDr. Lee said the new warning would not make him hesitate to prescribe the antidepressants.\nHe said, ''People can get agitated from them, but I've never seen somebody get suicidal from them.''\nDr. Joseph Gonzalez-Heydrich, chief of psychopharmacology at Children's Hospital Boston, said: ''I've heard anecdotally that a lot of antidepressants were being prescribed by pediatricians without a lot of training or experience. I think the warning is appropriate. If it makes prescribers more vigilant or parents more vigilant, that's a good thing.''\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nDr. Gonzalez-Heydrich said that a sizable minority of children became more agitated and irritable on the antidepressants in question. ''If we see it, we take them off it or reduce the dose,'' he said. ''Doing it that way there are a lot of kids we feel do benefit from these medications, especially long term. But they're not for everybody.''\nDr. Harold Koplewicz, director of New York University's Child Study Center, said, ''The fear I have about this warning is that many teenagers will not get the medicine because it will build resistance among their parents, and that's really a tragic outcome.'' He noted that suicide rates in teenagers had gone down in the United States and Sweden as use of the drugs increased.\nSeveral primary care doctors said that they had prescribed antidepressants with success for so many years that it was unlikely the F.D.A.'s new warnings would lead them to stop. Still, the warnings have given them pause, they said. They may think a bit harder before prescribing them to patients who are simply stressed, they said. And they will watch how the warnings play in the legal field, some said.\n''We're going to continue to use these drugs pretty freely until we start seeing the ads in the newspapers from lawyers saying, 'Have you or your family member been prescribed these drugs? If so, you may have a case,' '' said Dr. Phillip Kennedy, a family practice physician in Augusta, Ga. ''When the big L word, liability, raises its ugly head, that's when things will really change.''\nSpokesmen for drug companies said that they would emphasize to physicians that the F.D.A.'s warning did not conclude that antidepressants cause suicide. ''My hope is that people won't make a link with the drugs,'' said Jennifer Yoder, a spokeswoman for Eli Lilly & Company, maker of Prozac. ''I think the message will be that suicide is an inherent part of the disease of depression, and physicians should carefully monitor their patients.''\nCritics of the medicines said the F.D.A.'s warning was long overdue.\n''These warnings are not as strong as I would like, but they're an important first step,'' said Tom Woodward of North Wales, Pa. Mr. Woodward's teenage daughter, Julie, hanged herself six days after starting therapy with Zoloft.Overprescribing Prompted Warning on Antidepressants", "New York State Governor George E Pataki proposes number of changes to workers' compensation that would cut costs for employers and give employees who are legitimately injured better benefits; photo (M)Gov. George E.

Though Mr. Pataki said after the speech that his office had been in touch with the unions as the package was developed, Denis M.

He was 79.\nThe cause was a heart attack, his family said.\nA ninth-generation glassmaker, Mr. Riedel was president of the world-renowned Austrian family company from 1957 to 1994, when he was succeeded by his son Georg.\nSoon after taking control of the family business, which was founded in 1756, he began experimenting with the shapes of wineglasses. He concluded that a wine could taste notably different in variously shaped and sized glasses. He spent 16 years studying the physics of wine delivery to the mouth and taste buds and experimenting with different glass configurations, matching them with wines of different regions, different grapes and different ages.\nThe size of a glass, its thickness, the shape of its bell and the diameter of its rim contributed materially to the taste of the wine drunk from it, Mr. Riedel came to believe. The wine's balance, depth, harmony and complexity, he discovered, could and often did change from one glass to another.

We felt that lethal strikes that largely missed the terrorists if you don't have adequate targeting information, such as the cruise missile strikes in 1998, might lead Al Qaeda to believe that we lack resolve. These strikes had obviously not deterred Al Qaeda from subsequently attacking the U.S.S. Cole.\nWe wanted to move beyond the rollback policy of containment, criminal prosecution and limited retaliation for specific terrorist attacks. We wanted to destroy Al Qaeda. . . .\nEarly on, we realized that a serious effort to remove Al Qaeda's safe haven in Afghanistan might well require introducing military force, especially ground forces. . . .\nThe strategy would call for ending all sanctuaries given to Al Qaeda. We would try to do this first through diplomacy. But if diplomacy failed and there was a call for additional measures, including military operations, we would be prepared to do it. And military action would be more than just launching cruise missiles at already-warned targets. In fact, the strategy called for attacking Al Qaeda and the Taliban's leadership, their command and control, their ground forces and other targets.\nThe strategy would recognize a need for significant aid not only to the Northern Alliance, but to other tribal groups that might help us with this. . . .\nThis all continued throughout the summer. It reached a conclusion in early September, when all the pieces of our strategy came together. . . . It all came together on the 4th of September at a principals' meeting where we concluded our work on the national security directive that would be telling everybody in the administration what we were going to do as we moved forward. It took us roughly eight months to get to that point, but it was a solid eight months of dedicated work to bring us to that point.\nAnd then, as we all know, 9/11 hit, and we had to accelerate all of our efforts and go on to a different kind of footing altogether. . . .\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nThe Pentagon was starting to develop plans. It was looking at contingencies that it might have to deal with. . . .\nBut in this whole period, to say that use of military force to get Al Qaeda when it wasn't going to be a surgical strike -- anybody who thinks that Osama bin Laden might just be laying around somewhere and you can go pick him up -- well, maybe, good luck, but that's a wish, not a strategy or not a military action.\nSo you would have had really to go after Al Qaeda by going after the Taliban, and that meant invading another country, and it meant invading another country without the support of any of the surrounding countries where you would need some access to get there. . . .\nThe previous administration can speak for itself. They spoke for themselves. They said they didn't see it. And, frankly, in our first seven months in office, as we looked at this, we realized that it might come to that. That's the realization we come to. And you come to these kinds of realizations after a great deal of study and debate. You don't walk in on the first day, and say, ''We have decided this is what has to be done.''\nDEFENSE SECRETARY DONALD H. RUMSFELD -- Imagine that we were back before Sept. 11 and that a U.S. president had looked at the information then available, gone before the Congress and the world and said, ''We need to invade Afghanistan, overthrow the Taliban, and destroy the Al Qaeda terrorist network,'' based on what little was known before Sept. 11. How many countries would have joined? Many? Any? Not likely.\nWe would have heard objections to pre-emption similar to those voiced before the coalition-launched Operation Iraqi Freedom. We would have been asked how can you attack Afghanistan when it was Al Qaeda that attacked us, not the Taliban? How can you go to war when countries in the region don't support you? Won't launching such an invasion actually provoke terrorist attacks against the United States? . . .\nSome have asked when the administration came into office, was there consideration of how to deal with the U.S.S. Cole?\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter. You must select a newsletter to subscribe to.

View all New York Times newsletters.\nIt's a fair question. One concern was that launching another cruise-missile strike months after the fact might have sent a signal of weakness. Instead, we implemented the recommendations of the Cole commission and began developing a more comprehensive approach to deal with Al Qaeda. . . .\nSome have asked why wasn't bin Laden taken out, and if he had been hit, could it have prevented Sept. 11?\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nI know of no actionable intelligence since Jan. 20 that would have allowed the U.S. to capture or kill Osama bin Laden. . . .\nSecond, even if bin Laden had been captured or killed in the weeks before Sept. 11, no one I know believes it would necessarily have prevented Sept. 11. Killing bin Laden would not have removed the Al Qaeda's sanctuary in Afghanistan. Moreover, the sleeper cells that flew the aircraft into the World Trade towers and the Pentagon were already in the United States months before the attacks.\nSome have asked whether there were plans to go after Al Qaeda in Afghanistan before 9/11 and, if so, why weren't they successfully implemented?\nI have recently reviewed a briefing that I am told was presented to me in early February. The briefing I saw was not something that I would characterize as a comprehensive plan with Al Qaeda, to deal with Al Qaeda and the sanctuary in Afghanistan. It was a series of concepts or approaches. I am told that I asked the briefer many questions and that the team went back to work on refining it and that the work they did in the ensuing months helped to prepare the department for the successful invasion of Afghanistan soon after Sept. 11.\nThe N.S.C. was at work during the spring and summer of 2001 developing the new counterterrorism policy needed to inform new war plans. And we were at the same time in the process of overhauling U.S. contingency plans. . . .\nI think it's accurate to say that there were military options, and I'd characterize it as ''options,'' and not a comprehensive plan to deal with Al Qaeda and countries that harbor Al Qaeda, but options to react, response options, military-response options to deal with specific terrorist events. And I was briefed on them. . . .\nMy understanding is that the joint staff, after I was briefed and asked a lot of questions, went back down and continued working on those response plans throughout that period and that that was one of the reasons why we were in a position to respond so promptly after Sept. 11.\nFORMER SECRETARY OF STATE MADELEINE K. ALBRIGHT -- I can say with confidence that President Clinton and his team did everything we could, everything that we could think of, based on the knowledge we had, to protect our people and disrupt and defeat Al Qaeda. We certainly recognized the threat posed by the terrorist groups. . . .\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nBut I also do know that many of the policy issues that we had developed were not followed up.\nAnd I have to say with great sadness to watch an incoming administration kind of take apart a lot of the policies that we did have, whether it had to do with North Korea or the Balkans, was difficult. So I think you have to ask people that were in the Bush administration as to how they saw things on this particular issue. But I do think, in all fairness, that 9/11 was a cataclysmic event that changed things and that they must have had similar reactions. But clearly there are many issues and many questions now about how they were responding to the terrorist threat and how seriously they took it.\nFORMER DEFENSE SECRETARY WILLIAM S. COHEN -- Our plans were to try to, quote, capture and/or kill -- or kill, I should say in this particular case -- capture or kill bin Laden. That was the directive that went out. . . .\nWere there plans to use special forces to supplement the Northern Alliance if they were able to apprehend and hold on to bin Laden? The answer was yes. There were packages that were developed with our special forces at Fort Bragg.\nThere were a number of proposals, quote, on the table or on the shelf prepared to be utilized in the event that we were certain, not certain to 100 percent degree, but reasonably certain that he was going to be at a given area.\nI know a question has been raised, well, why wouldn't you put a unit in there with the anticipation that they could help gather intelligence and track him down? And I tried to address this in my written statement. But consider the notion we have 13,500 troops in Afghanistan right now, not to mention the Pakistanis, and we can't find bin Laden to date.\nSo, the notion that you're going to put a small unit, however good, on the ground, or a large unit and put them into Afghanistan and track down bin Laden, I think, is folly. But if we had people on the ground, if we had the Northern Alliance, if they were reliable, did we have people prepared to go? The answer was yes. . . .\nSo, the answer is, why didn't you have forces on the ground in Afghanistan? And the point I'm simply trying to make is that the notion that you could put thousands, or hundreds, or even tens of people on the ground and hope to locate him under those circumstances I think is simply unrealistic.THREATS AND RESPONSES; Excerpts From Testimony by Clinton and Bush Officials to the Sept. 11 Commission", "Record-high price of gasoline becomes one of most contentious issues in Washington, with presidential candidates and members of Congress rushing to assign blame and propose ways to lower voters' costs at gas pump; senators call on Bush administration to release oil from Strategic Petroleum Reserve to help curb prices; Sen John Kerry, presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, accuses Pres Bush of neglecting energy conservation and favoring oil companies; Bush re-election campaign blames Kerry for voting against oil drilling in Alaska last year and for his past advocacy of higher gasoline taxes (M)Mr. Bush also mentioned that 50-cent tax in a campaign appearance in Florida on Saturday, saying, ''He wanted you to pay all that money at the pump and wouldn't even throw in a free carwash.''\nMr. Kerry has said in the past that the 50-cent tax was merely an idea floated to reduce the federal deficit in 1992, that he never voted for it and that by the mid-1990's he had decided it was a bad idea.\nHe said on Tuesday, in a statement from Sun Valley, Idaho, where he is vacationing, that consumers were paying a ''Bush gas tax'' because prices had increased 11.5 percent during his administration. ''The profits from gasoline sales go to overpaid oil company executives and other countries,'' he added.\nInstead of trying to ''drill our way to independence,'' Mr. Kerry said, the United States should focus on conservation and domestic sources of renewable energy.\nMeanwhile, on Capitol Hill, Democrats faulted the administration as not responding to ease the price increase. Three Democratic senators, Charles E. Schumer of New York, Barbara Boxer of California and Harry Reid of Nevada, called on the Energy Department to offer petroleum from the reserve to oil companies now, in exchange for repayment in a few months of the original plus interest, paid in oil. The department has used the technique before, and it is attractive at times like this, when prices for delivery in future months are lower than spot prices now.\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The reserve now holds nearly 650 million barrels, a record, but the level of imports has risen even faster than the reserve has grown.\nMr. Abraham is far from alone in opposing the release of oil from the reserve. Lawrence J. Goldstein, president of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation, a nonprofit group in New York, said in a telephone interview that the government should not be interfering with prices in a free market.\n''This is not tinkering; this is tampering,'' Mr. Goldstein said.\nThe reserve should be saved for occasions when its oil is needed to protect the economy, he added, but right now the economy is growing.\nMs. Boxer, appearing with Mr. Schumer on Tuesday, said: ''Mr. Goldstein would be right if we were dealing with a free market in oil. We're not.

I don't care who wins.''\nPacker is almost always straightforward and obsessively detailed about strategy. His analysis is quick and candid, without histrionics or a special language all his own. In a way, he hasn't changed much from his college days.\n''He was always one step ahead of everybody else,'' said Len Chappell, the seminal star among Packer's Wake Forest teammates.\nBob Woollard, another member of that team, said: ''He was a floor leader. We considered him the little general. He was a forceful leader, someone you could look to for leadership. He was sharp, thoughtful and not a wise guy, but very positive and very sure of himself.''\nPacker, 64, confessed that he was not all that different than he was growing up as the son of Tony Packer, who coached the Lehigh basketball team.

Clarke, the former counterterrorism chief (''Ex-Bush Aide, Finding Fault, Sets Off Debate,'' front page, March 23), raises two interesting questions.\nFirst, if Bush administration officials were as serious about Al Qaeda as they say, why did they downgrade Mr. Clarke's counterterrorism post at the beginning of the administration?\nSecond, if Vice President Dick Cheney is correct in stating that Mr. Clarke was not in the ''loop,'' why would an administration that says it is serious about terrorism not keep its chief counterterrorism expert in the loop?\nI believe that the answer is obvious.

They have depicted him as a self-promoter, out of the loop and an ally of Senator John Kerry, the presumptive Democratic presidential candidate.\nMr. Clarke, who says he helped save Americans from state-sponsored attacks from Iraq and Iran and foiled attempts by Al Qaeda to stage attacks, was unbowed. He had anticipated the Bush administration onslaught, saying in his book that its officials are ''adept at revenge.''\n''They've got lots of people, on taxpayers' dollars by the way, out refuting these charges,'' Mr. Clarke said on Tuesday on ''Good Morning America'' on ABC. ''But they're not really going after the main charge. They're throwing lots of things up in the air, flak, to divert me.''\nThe man at the center of the maelstrom is a ghostly pale balding bureaucrat who has spent the greater part of a three-decade career in government unknown to most Americans. The son of a chocolate factory worker from Pennsylvania, Mr. Clarke, 53, earned degrees at the University of Pennsylvania and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He is single, and known for keeping long hours, and he was one of a handful of White House officials allowed to carry a gun for protection.\nHis career and his personal profile have been anything but ordinary. Mr. Clarke, who worked prominently under Republicans and Democrats alike, has had roles in some of the most sensitive foreign policy initiatives of the past generation.\nHis bland official titles, most recently national coordinator for security, infrastructure protection and counterterrorism, followed by special assistant to the president for cyberspace security, belie considerable intrigue. According to biographical accounts and interviews, he drew up plans in 1986 that were never put into effect to ''destabilize'' Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, the Libyan leader; coordinated the disastrous American intervention in Somalia and a smoother one in Haiti; and detected Iranian complicity in the Khobar Towers bombing in 1996 in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nFor a time, he occupied the office used by Lt. Col. Oliver L.

In 1992, he was forced out of a senior position at the Bush administration's State Department and moved to the White House after the inspector general of the department had accused him of looking the other way when Israel transferred sophisticated American military technology to China.\nIn an interview in 1999 with The New York Times, Mr. Clarke justified his action, saying the pressure to punish Israel was part of a ploy. ''The bottom line,'' he said, ''was I wasn't going to lie. I wasn't going to go along with an administration strategy to pressure the Israeli government.''\nAt the White House, supporters praised his pragmatic style and critics bristled at his propensity to set his own rules. He found a staunch ally in W. Anthony Lake, Mr. Clinton's national security adviser. In his book ''Six Nightmares,'' Mr. Lake called Mr. Clarke ''one of the smartest, most effective public servants I have known.''\n''He is a bulldog of a bureaucrat,'' Mr. Lake wrote, ''notorious among his colleagues for utter devotion to those he works for, fierce loyalty and support toward those who work for him and a bluntness toward those at his level that has not earned him universal affection.''\nAs terrorist threats began to multiply, colleagues relied on Mr. Clarke to cut red tape. In November 2000, Robert S. Gelbard, the American ambassador to Indonesia, desperately sought American agents to thwart what he believed was spying for a terrorist attack against his embassy in Jakarta. When Mr. Gelbard ran into bureaucratic roadblocks, Mr. Clarke set up a teleconference and ''browbeat'' officials to action, Mr. Gelbard said. Evidence later showed that the embassy was indeed in terrorists' sights, he said.\nAs Mr. Bush prepared to take office in January 2001, Condoleezza Rice, who became national security adviser, decided to keep Mr. Clarke as the counterterrorism expert at the National Security Council. Ms. Rice, who knew Mr. Clarke from her work with President George H. W. Bush, considered him talented, if unruly, and wanted as much continuity as possible on counterterrorism, administration officials said.\nMr. Clarke was not happy Ms. Rice downgraded him, which resulted in his exclusion from some high-level meetings, the officials said.\nOn March 7, 2001, a senior administration official said, Ms. Rice assigned Mr. Clarke to develop a comprehensive strategy to eliminate Al Qaeda, not just roll it back. His work over the spring and summer was the basis for a strategy document for dealing with the network that won high-level White House approval on Sept. 4.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nMr. Clarke, by his own account in the book, was obsessed with Al Qaeda and Osama bin Laden. He relentlessly pressed administration officials for a more assertive policy to combat terrorism, including stronger use of the military.\nThe White House on Tuesday sought to blunt Mr. Clarke's assertions by releasing his resignation letter. In it, he praised Mr. Bush for his ''courage, determination, calm and leadership'' on Sept. 11.\nVice President Dick Cheney, speaking on Monday on the syndicated Rush Limbaugh radio program, noted there had been several attacks on Mr. Clarke's watch, including the bombings of the Cole and the embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, in the Clinton years.THREATS AND RESPONSES: THE TERRORISM EXPERT; 'Go-to Guy' Sheds Bureaucrat's Anonymity", "New York State Lobbying Commission is itself subject of conversation at commission's own press conference after it placed rule of silence on outspoken executive director David M Grandeau; commission called conference to announce report on ethical concerns over special interest groups' increased spending, but is also forced to answer questions about agency infighting (M)Commissioners let it be known publicly that they had been privately discussing whether they still had confidence in Mr. Grandeau.\nAt the commission's regular meeting Tuesday morning, commissioners even fought one another on usually routine matters like the approval of the minutes of their last meetings.\nMr. Grandeau, who has become known for speaking his mind here -- publicly questioning the constitutionality of the law that gives him his mandate, picking fights with the state attorney general's office and turning his focus on unpopular targets like civil liberties groups -- was unusually reticent when asked about the rule of silence.\n''Well, I've been asked by my commissioners not to discuss that matter with the media anymore,'' he said, in what soon became a refrain.\nThe turmoil at the commission troubled several government watchdog groups, which said that they saw the lobbying commission as that rarest of creatures in Albany: an aggressive ethics committee.\nThey worried that the internal dissension could weaken it, and that the new rule of silence could ultimately make it a less effective body.\nThe commission's problems come at a moment when many watchdog groups are pushing Albany to strengthen its lobbying laws to close a gaping loophole: while lobbyists are currently required to disclose their work to influence new laws, they are not required to disclose their work to help clients win valuable state contracts.\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Bulgaro, who was Mr. Silver's nominee to the commission, passed a motion ordering the commission and its staff to ''make no public statement or comment in response to inquiries from the press or any other party on any individual matter not yet placed before the commission board.''\nAn aide to Mr. Silver said that no one in his office had requested the change.\nSome commission officials said that the motion was intended to protect the subjects of investigations, who would no longer be subject to embarrassing revelations until their cases were complete and all the facts were known.\nBut some government watchdogs complained that the motion may be too broad, effectively silencing a committee whose central purpose is shining a light on the operations of lobbyists.\nFor several days, Mr. Grandeau said publicly that he disagreed with the new rule but would abide by it. After a contentious closed-door meeting with his members here on Tuesday, Mr. Grandeau told reporters that the commissioner had asked him to stop discussing his opinions of the new rules.\n''I've been asked by the commissioners not to discuss that matter with the media anymore,'' he said again.\nWhen asked how the commission's new rules squared with a statement in the commission's report that ''disclosure and oversight is a safeguard to better and honest government at all levels,'' Mr. Grandeau said, ''I've been asked by the commissioners not to comment on a matter like that.''Watchdogs Worry That Ethics Group Has Been Hobbled", "Dan Barry About New York column discusses increase in murders targeting food deliverymen in New York City, like murder of Ming Garden employee Huang Chen, who was killed by two teenagers while delivering Chinese food (M)Nearly six weeks have passed since Huang Chen, 18 years old, the youngest of three children and the only son of Ming Garden's owners, delivered a chicken dinner to a seventh-floor apartment in one of those brown buildings. Delivering takeout is how Mr. Chen died.\nThe authorities say that two 16-year-old boys decided to set up the deliveryman, that they stabbed him and beat him with a baseball bat for fear that he could identify them, that they wheeled his body out in a shopping cart before shoving it into his car, that they dumped his body in a pond about three miles away and that from this endeavor they realized about $50.\nThe boys were charged with murder, and the news media briefly revisited one of this city's continuing narratives, the victimizing of Asian food deliverymen. John C. Liu, a city councilman from Queens, who is Asian-American, called for a one-day moratorium on such deliveries, and suggested that while picking up their food, customers get to know the people on the counter's other side.\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\nPEOPLE needed to be reminded ''that there are human lives and human faces behind the preparation and delivery of their food,'' Mr. Liu said this week. The reminder was necessary, he added, because he detects a racist component to the beating and killing of deliverymen -- men like Mr. Chen.\n''It's as though we're not American,'' Mr. Liu said, his voice rising in anger. ''We're not human, even. We're not real people.''\nSome restaurants joined the moratorium; others sent out their deliverymen as usual, laden with white plastic bags. After a few days the Ming Garden reopened, the only change being a different collection of Asian-American faces behind the plexiglass -- though Mr. Liu questions whether customers noticed even that much.\nThe Chen family has left their Ming Garden, and they will not be returning. The father will no longer hover in the kitchen; since the murder he rarely leaves the family home in Woodside, Queens. The mother will no longer work the cash register; for more than a week after her son's death, she would not eat or leave her bedroom. For a time she even refused to open her eyes, as if hoping that all this was just a dream.\nNow it is Hing Lei Wong, a distant relative, who will be working 12 hours a day, seven days a week. On Monday afternoon he stepped out from behind the locked door that separates staff from customers to explain that he has been running the restaurant, and will soon be its new owner.\nMr. Wong said he will also be both cook and deliveryman. ''It is very hard to get anyone to deliver the food,'' he said.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nThe new person at the cash register was soon calling for him.

The report spurred hopes that the economy, which has been hindered by slow consumer spending, was finally on the mend.\nFor all of 2003, the economy grew 3.1 percent -- its slowest rate since the 1997-98 Asian financial crisis. In the first half, South Korea entered its first recession since that crisis. Though robust exports powered the economy out of recession in the third quarter, consumer spending has been sluggish, and slipped an additional 0.5 percent in the fourth quarter, the Bank of Korea said.\nBut the rise in fourth-quarter gross domestic product, which was seasonally adjusted, led economists to project a recovery in spending, as strong exports, led by semiconductors and automobiles, prompt more businesses to expand production. This expansion in capital expenditure is expected to create more jobs, which will in turn allow more South Koreans to spend.\nExports rose almost 11 percent from the previous three months. Capital spending grew 4.3 percent to meet growing export demand.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nEconomists said the next crucial indication of recovery would be how fast consumer spending picked up.

Estrada, Mr. Feldman said Congress intended to encourage the formation of managed-care plans by providing a system of limited liability.\n''To allow states to essentially say, as the state has said here, 'Well, we're going to provide an additional remedy that Congress rejected when it drew that careful balance' would be to completely undermine Congress's decisions about how this system should be structured,'' Mr. Feldman said.\nUnder Erisa, patients can sue for the dollar value of services found to have been improperly denied, but not for damages resulting from the denial. The Texas law, by contrast, makes managed-care plans ''liable for damages for harm'' caused by a failure to ''exercise ordinary care when making health care treatment decisions.''

Young, the patients' lawyer, said the inability of people like his clients to recover damages under federal law had necessitated the state's action. ''What Texas has done is to fill a vacuum and say we are going to set out a professional medical standard of care when H.M.O.'s make medical necessity decisions,'' Mr. Young told the court.\nHe said that under the companies' position ''they would be free to say we're going to use the medical-necessity standard of a witch doctor or whatever we decide it is.''\nBoth Justice Antonin Scalia and Chief Justice William H.

The claimant didn't want to lay out the additional money for the Vioxx.''\nMr. Young replied: ''Well, the truth is, Your Honor, that neither of these claimants would have needed health insurance if they had the independent means to just whip out a gold card and pay for the drug.''\nDavid C. Mattax, an assistant attorney general from Texas, defended his state's law by emphasizing that it did not impose liability on the patient's employer, but rather for the negligent exercise of medical judgment by the managed-care company. ''We will regulate that as a separate duty, separate and apart from Erisa,'' Mr. Mattax said.\nSeparately on Tuesday, the court ruled unanimously in a Clean Water Act case from the Florida Everglades that a pumping station that conveys pollution from one body of water to another remains subject to the law's requirement for a permit, even if the pump is not itself the source of the pollution.\nBut the court sidestepped the most provocative assertion in the case, put forward by the Bush administration: that no permit is required in that circumstance because all the country's navigable waters are ''unitary.'' Since the law requires a permit for the ''addition'' of pollution to the water, pollution that is simply moved within the ''unitary'' water system cannot be said to be added, the administration argued.\nWriting for the court today in South Florida Water Management District v.

While that debate goes on, we hope that someone focuses on this oddity: at a time when the nation is obsessively worrying about obesity, the bill seems to do everything it can to make sure that Americans continue sitting in their cars for as much time as possible.\nSome 80 percent of the six-year $300 billion bill would go to road-building projects, with most of the rest financing mass transit. Less than 1 percent would be allotted for pedestrian and bicycle paths.\nBy giving Americans more reasons to pick up the car keys instead of their sneakers, the bill gives new meaning to the word pork.\nThe Natural Resources Defense Council, a national nonprofit group focused on the environment and public health issues, has been urging Congress to do its part and require state and local transportation planners to consider how they can address the problem of obesity.

Upon retirement, he said he might continue his education and begin a quest to enter politics.\n''I always wanted to be either a professional basketball player or the president of the United States,'' said Howard, who is often asked for his autograph in public. ''I hope to do both. I'll be the first black president.''\nThe sense of destiny is palpable in the Howard household. Howard Sr. said his wife lost seven children, including two sets of twins, to miscarriages, and their three children have been reared to believe they are here for special assignments.\n''We try to explain to them that you're looking at a situation where you have 10 children and out of those 10, seven of them have gone on to be with the Lord, but three of them were allowed to be here on earth for some reason,'' Howard Sr. said. ''I think Dwight's grabbing a hold of what his reason is.''\nLast summer, Howard became aware that his dream of entering the N.B.A. from high school could be a reality. Voted the most promising prospect at the N.B.A. players association camp last June, Howard was told by scouts and former and current players who ran the camp that he had the physical and mental tools necessary to play in the N.B.A. Scoring consistently in one-on-one games against Marc Jackson, the Philadelphia 76ers center, emboldened Howard.\nLater, Howard consulted with North Carolina Coach Roy Williams and Duke Coach Mike Krzyzewski, and both told him he was ready for the N.B.A.\nThough Howard averaged 25 points, 18 rebounds and 8 blocks in leading Southwest Atlanta Christian to the state title, scouts do not expect him to excel as James has as a rookie. Like most players who have skipped college, even the stars, he figures to need time to develop.\nWith a lean but muscular 250-pound frame, he is projected as a power forward who can run the floor, handle the ball and shoot like a small forward.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n''He has a chance to be in the Hall of Fame,'' Vaccaro said. ''That's how good I think Dwight Howard is. He's a Tim Duncan. Absolutely. Blocking shots, shooting the ball, running the court. He's Timmy.''\nHoward says he knows the N.B.A. will be more than a physical challenge. He is already preparing for life outside the arena.\n''I have to always make sure I'm on top of my game off the court,'' Howard said. ''I have to make sure I stay away from the things that would make me fall into temptation. I don't want to put myself in any predicament of messing up the name that I've got for myself. The guys here already know that I'm not going to go out and party all night and have sex and all that. I want them to look at me as a regular person and say, 'Dwight's someone you can look up to.' ''6-11 Prep Star May Be No. 1 In N.B.A. Draft", "New Jersey legislators debate whether proposed campaign finance reforms should apply to state level only, or extend down to county and municipal levels as well; Assembly proposal would prohibit those who hold large state contracts from donating to gubernatorial candidates, but leaves out county and city candidates (M)Gov. James E. McGreevey has insisted that pay-to-play legislation apply to all levels of government. The overmatched, outspent Republicans have agreed, and the Senate approved a comprehensive bill last year with practically no dissent. But Assembly Democrats have blocked the bill, and now they say they can support only a limited version.\nTheir proposal -- no bills are written yet -- would bar those holding state contracts worth $17,500 or more from donating to candidates for governor or the state party organizations. The Assembly plan would also require public bidding on all state contracts for professional services, which are now awarded on a no-bid basis. The contractors -- law and engineering firms, bond underwriters and the like -- are often big campaign donors.\nRepublicans say -- and many Democrats privately agree -- that the Assembly plan, by leaving out the county and municipal governments, would not only protect their pay-to-play politics but would also increase the influence of the county bosses. They say it would funnel more campaign cash to them that otherwise would have gone to the state party committees.\nIn last fall's legislative campaigns, while the two state party committees raised $17 million, the county party organizations raised a total of almost $30 million.\nThe Assembly Democrats would not prohibit contractors from donating to individual candidates or to the legislative political action committees. The current limits on those contributions are considerably lower than those on gifts to the county organizations.\nIn announcing the plan last week, Assembly Speaker Albio Sires said cutting off the local groups would be politically difficult. ''I don't think at this time that I can get that through,'' Mr. Sires said.\nMajority Leader Joseph J. Roberts Jr. said that even if a comprehensive measure could win enough votes, ''I don't think that's the right way to go from a policy point of view.''\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

''We have to clean up our own house first and see how it works.''\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nWhen the new legislative session began in January, advocates of campaign finance reform seemed resigned to defeat. For two years the Assembly had repelled pay-to-play legislation. Mr. McGreevey insisted that he would veto any but the most stringent measures -- a stance that his critics said was meant as a poison pill to forestall any interruption in the Democrats' brisk intake of cash for the 2005 elections.\nThe Republicans, who had pushed a state-level pay-to-play bill through the Senate earlier, responded with a bill extending it to counties and municipalities. The Senate approved that measure, too, but Assembly leaders blocked it.\nThe Assembly leaders' public turnabout came as a federal investigation of political corruption arrived in Trenton, in the form of subpoenas issued in the last few weeks to the Democratic State Committee and the governor's office.\nBut Mr. Sires and Mr. Roberts said they had been discussing new ethics measures with good-government groups since January.\nMs. Reed of Rutgers attributed the Assembly's newfound interest to a quickening of voter concern about public corruption during the fall campaign, a concern apparent in the Eagleton Institute's research, as more and more public officials appeared on front pages as criminal defendants. ''Important public issues move when there's a kind of catharsis, when the problems are understood by lots of people,'' she said. ''You have to have a kind of drama.''\nA final package of ethics laws could take many forms. The Assembly leaders propose tougher disclosure rules, a pilot program for publicly financed legislative elections and new limits on spending by advocacy groups, modeled on the federal McCain-Feingold legislation.\nMany people urge restrictions on the transfer of funds from one county to another, a practice known as ''wheeling,'' which enables influential party leaders to manipulate elections outside their districts. ''That's what's offensive about the system,'' said Dale Florio, the Republican chairman in Somerset County. ''The money turns up 150 miles away.''\nThe Senate's position now is not clear. The Senate president, Richard J. Codey, said in a statement on the Assembly plan, ''I won't single out our differences at this point, because there is far more here upon which we all agree.''\nMr. McGreevey has not made any public statement on the proposals. Aides to the governor said he had not decided whether to insist on a ban at all levels. ''It's one we're committed to, but I don't know how it's going to end up,'' said Eric Shuffler, the counselor to the governor.Legislators Debate Reach of Ethics Plan", "France's Alcatel signs deal to build Iran's first private high-speed Internet network; Alcatel, in partnership with Iran's AsreDanesh Afzar, plans to install 100,000 broadband DSL lines over next three years, with 23,000 by May (S)Alcatel, the French telecommunications company, said yesterday that it had signed a deal to build Iran's first private high-speed Internet network.

Then, hundreds of villages were burned as Serbian security forces sought to expel the majority ethnic Albanians -- some 1.8 million people -- from the territory.\nThe United States government estimates that up to 10,000 Albanians were killed in massacres by the Serbian police and paramilitaries.\nIn March 1999, NATO forces intervened with a bombing campaign. By June, the Serbian forces withdrew and the United Nations was placed in charge of the province. Some 800,000 Albanian refugees began to return home. Many of them sought revenge against their Serbian neighbors, and once again whole villages went up in flames.\nUnited Nations officials have said that progress has been made and that interethnic violence has declined. But analysts say the underlying cause of those conflicts has never been addressed, even by the United Nations: What should become of Kosovo?\nThe ethnic Albanians want independence. The Serbs, who make up less than 10 percent of the population, want to return to Serbian rule. Albanian hard-liners, some United Nations officials believe, want to redraw the province's ethnic map again, by seeking to fuel interethnic hatred.\nA senior police commander said the apparent failure of the peacekeepers demonstrated how their concern over possible mass violence had diminished as interethnic relations appeared to improving.\n''Maybe we were a little bit sleepy,'' said Lt. Col. Jerzy Szezytynski, the commander of the Polish Special Police Unit in Kosovo, who has worked in the province since 1999. ''It was a big surprise for all of us.'' But he said the United Nations -- with more than 3,000 troops in the northern region, bolstered by several hundred police officers -- should have been able to stop the violence. ''It was a failure,'' he said.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nA spokesman for the French brigade in charge in northern Kosovo, Lt. Matthieu Mabin, said the violence had spread too quickly and across too wide an area. ''We can't protect everywhere all of the time,'' he said. ''It's the reality on the ground, very simply.''\nThe United Nations' spokeswoman in Kosovo, Jing Hua, said the United Nations troops had restored order quickly. ''The developments here took everyone by surprise,'' she said, ''but within two days they had gained control of the situation.''\nThe situation remains volatile, however. Two policemen were killed late Tuesday when their patrol car came under fire on the main road between Kosovo's capital, Pristina, and Pudujevo, close to the boundary with Serbia.\nSvinjare villagers said they were alerted to the possibility of an attack last Thursday, a day after violence erupted in the neighboring city of Mitrovica. That afternoon, a United Nations police car drove at high speed toward the north of Svinjare. Svinjare was the only Serbian village bordering the Albanian-dominated south of Mitrovica, just half a mile away.\nThe rioting was continuing in Mitrovica for a second day. Villagers said the entrance to Svinjare was being protected by a truck filled with seven or eight Moroccan peacekeepers. Lieutenant Mabin, the French brigade spokesman, said 20 soldiers were on duty.\nPedrag Antic, 49, a former electrician, said he was standing at the end of the village with four other men when the speeding United Nations police car slowed to pull alongside the Moroccan patrol. Within seconds, he said, several hundred youths came into sight, running along the road by the perimeter fence of the French base.\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

''I can't even find the words to describe how fast they were coming,'' he said.\nSuddenly, he said three armored United Nations police jeeps carrying 12 officers came from behind the youths and reached the edge of the village before them. But the mob continued to advance, and within minutes, he said, houses at the village's northern end were being set alight. In less than 15 minutes, he said, perhaps a dozen houses were ablaze.\n''We were shouting at the police to stop them,'' he said.\nMr. Antic's cousin, Milas Antic, 49, recalled his terror. ''I thought we would all be dead,'' he said.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nPedrag Antic and several other villagers said the United Nations police officers and the Moroccan patrol did nothing to stop the mob but drove parallel to it as the young men threw Molotov cocktails, set more buildings on fire and fired guns.\nA regional commander of the United Nations police said his unit fired 7 to 10 shots to ward off the group.\nThe mixed convoy of police and military vehicles drew to a halt several hundred yards into the village, ahead of the mob, forming a roadblock. Villagers said the youths began to pull back.\nMeanwhile, as a precaution, soldiers arranged for the village's women and children to be taken to the French base, Camp Belvedere. But then the soldiers told the villagers that they could not defend the village, and that every one would have to leave.\nSvinjare had been reinforced by then, according to the United Nations police and the peacekeeping force, with an additional 20 soldiers and 50 Polish antiriot police officers.\n''We asked them if they could secure us, but they were trying to convince us they were not able, because they had to go elsewhere,'' Pedrag Antic said.\nThe decision to evacuate was taken by the French general responsible for Northern Kosovo, Gen. Xavier Michel, Lieutenant Mabin said, because the French forces were needed elsewhere. He said he did not know where.\n''We had a choice between human lives or houses,'' he said. ''It was clear we had to save lives.''\nThe families were loaded onto a bus. ''People were crying and yelling,'' said Capt. Cezary Luba of the Polish unit. Most villagers said they left with nothing but the clothes they were wearing.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nThe Polish troops were also ordered to leave the village, the police said. The threats to Albanians were spreading; the Poles were sent to help protect groups of Albanian-speaking Roma in a town to the south of Mitrovica. But their commander, Colonel Szezytynski, said there were still enough peacekeepers in the village to defend it. ''There were only five houses burning when they left,'' he said, referring to his men. ''When they passed by again all the houses were on fire.''\nAbout 100 men from the village made their way on foot to the base, which lies on a hill overlooking the village. So they saw the mob returning, shortly after nightfall, he said, and they saw the fires.\nGraffiti left on the scorched walls suggests the Albanians intended to rebuild the village for themselves. ''Taken by Qerkim,'' ''Taken by Safeti,'' and other Albanian names.\nThe peacekeepers evacuated 204 people to the French camp; they have now been moved to an empty housing project in the Serb-dominated northern side of Mitrovica, on a hill where they can still see their village.\n''We really believed KFOR would come to protect us, but you see how it turned out,'' said Milorad Vasic, referring to the peacekeeping force. Mr. Vasic fled his house with his wife and three children.\n''We lived in hope,'' he said. ''We counted on them. They told us they were democrats. We thought it would get better.

Reeder, senior vice president of CB Richard Ellis in Greenville, northwest of Wilmington.\nKeystone bought the building in October for $6.28 million, or $36 a square foot. By contrast, the building next door, known as the Chase Manhattan Center, sold in 2002 for $185 a square foot, according to Robert J. Fahey, executive vice president of CB Richard Ellis in Philadelphia.\nTo bring the Pei building up to top-tier space, Keystone said it planned to spend $6 million on improvements. Initial plans called for coating the exterior of the building with a product that would change the raw concrete color to a toothpaste-white. Other proposed changes included a green-granite base to the first story and vertical decorative brackets at each floor along an inside corner of the exterior.\nThe city's architects were appalled, describing it as akin to a makeover of Frank Lloyd Wright's Fallingwater, a masterpiece of residential design near Pittsburgh.\n''We didn't want to lose the historical, architectural context of the building and the period from which it came because that period is gone,'' said Todd T. Breck, president of the Delaware chapter of the American Institute of Architects.\nChanges now will be more on the interior. Exterior changes, which include an aluminum canopy over the entrance, new windows and frames, and a granite base in a light, complementary color, will be sensitive to Mr. Pei's initial design, said the architect on the project, Thomas E. Hall, principal with Thomas E. Hall & Associates in Wayne, Pa.\nThe exterior concrete is to be cleaned and stained a lighter color, but not a stark white. Work has begun on the staining and making outside repairs where concrete has been flaking off.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nMr. Pei, who said from his New York office that he had not seen the building in at least 25 years, said he thought it was ''wrong'' to put granite cladding on the ground floor, no matter what the color.\n''The best way is to clean it and put a silicone coating on it,'' he said.\nLocal architects said they understood that the building needed some attention to make it more marketable. Office buildings, unlike paintings or sculpture, are supposed to earn their keep, said Eldon du Pont Homsey, president of Homsey Architects Inc.\nMr. Homsey, who describes himself as a great admirer of the Pei building, said that although it would not be his choice to put granite cladding on the first floor he understood the owner's desire to make the building more pedestrian friendly.\n''It's understandable given the need to compete with other office buildings,'' Mr. Homsey said.\nMr. Hall, the project's architect, said he thought the new design achieved a balance between beauty and marketability.\n''A building that is empty is not successful,'' he said. ''If you can keep the architectural character of the building and lease it, then it's successful. I believe we can do both.''\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter.

One example is the Hotel du Pont in the DuPont Company's headquarters building where people have gathered since 1913.\nMBNA, the credit card bank whose headquarters are near the Pei building on Rodney Square, avoided controversy last year when it began renovating a 1916 public building for its new headquarters by making very few changes to the exterior. Plans to fit out the building for executive offices have since been scrapped as the bank moves into a more cost-conscious phase. The building, which is connected to MBNA's headquarters building by a pedestrian bridge, will be used for other bank functions that have yet to be determined.\nMany Wilmington residents still recall the construction of the Pei building and how the project took six years to finish.\n''We're invested in that building because it took so long to complete,'' said Richard V. Pryor, the city's director of economic development who acted as an informal mediator between the architects and Keystone.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nConstructed by the American Life Insurance Company primarily as an investment, it was built on a 120-by-200-foot lot that had formerly been the site of a small hotel.\nMr. Pei designed the building, then known as the Wilmington Tower, to cover only 70 percent of the site so it would not overwhelm its smaller-scale neighbors, including a former Civil War-era mansion now used as a clubhouse by the Wilmington Club, a social club.\nReal estate brokers remember that the building, with 174,000 square feet of rentable space, failed to fill up after it opened. Nearly a year after completion American Life occupied an annex to the building, while the tower had just two tenants, both law firms. Rental rates were dropped by 25 percent and the building was quietly put up for sale.\nKeystone's plan is to reposition the building from several standpoints, including internal systems, energy efficiency, external appearance and leasing strategy, said Gregory R. Hansen, senior vice president with Keystone.\nVisitors to the building are likely to see the most dramatic changes in the lobby, which currently has a cavelike feel with towering raw concrete walls and little natural light.\nTo create a more inviting entrance, space that had been used for offices will be incorporated into a new 6,000-square-foot lobby. In addition, a first-floor glass wall will be added on the northern side facing 12th Street.\nThe lobby space will include a mezzanine with decorative staircase. Plans are to lease that space to a restaurant or shops.\nBecause there is nothing that can be done to expand the small floor sizes, Keystone said it intended to market space to tenants such as law firms or financial companies looking for one or two floors. There are plans to build another adjoining tower next to the building.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nThe current asking rate of $22 a square foot annually will be raised to $24.50 a square foot when renovations are completed by fall, Mr. Hansen said.\nThe effective rent for top-of-the line space in the city ranges from $22 to $26 a square foot, Mr. Reeder, the broker, said.\n''I think it will lease -- the views are spectacular -- but it will take a little bit more time,'' he said ''because of its small floor plates and the type of tenants that will be attracted to this type of building.''COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE; Architects Protect a Controversial Modern Building", "Mercedes-Benz USA's new advertising campaign uses photos sent in by Mercedes-Benz owners and short vignettes of real drivers to capitalize on automaker's heritage at time when it does not have any new cars to show off and its overall quality reputation has slipped; campaign was developed by Merkley & Partners; photo (M)Ms. Cervantez declined to say how much Mercedes was spending on the new campaign.

The ad ends with the words: ''The love never fades.'' ''Multiple Portraits'' is set to much faster paced techno-music and ends with the words ''No one every poses with their toaster.''\nAnother ad, called ''Faithful Vignettes,'' features short clips of people with compelling stories to tell about their cars.

''But there's rising competition from everywhere. Everyone is fighting for that one-tenth of 1 percent of market share.''\nIn 2003, Mercedes was within a few thousand units of being overtaken by General Motors' emboldened Cadillac brand for the No.3 spot in the luxury segment behind Lexus and BMW. Sales of Infiniti, meanwhile, grew 35 percent last year, according to Ward's AutoInfoBank, to 118,655 units on the strength of its new G35 sedan and coupe. Mercedes sales were up 9.6 percent in 2003, to 218,717 units.\nMercedes is also battling a blow to its sterling reputation in quality and reliability.\nMercedes has been plagued by quality problems that not only knocked it off the top of a J.D. Power initial quality rating last year, but also pushed it down to No.15, which is just above the industry average.\nEarlier this year, the influential Consumer Reports' annual auto issue ranked Mercedes, along with BMW, Volvo, Jaguar and Audi, below average for reliability.\n''The reputation of the Mercedes brand has bought them some time to address the quality problems,'' said Susan Jacobs, president of Jacobs & Associates, an automotive research firm in Rutherford, N.J. ''They seem to be stepping up to the issues. So I haven't scaled back my estimates for Mercedes sales in 2004.''\nWhile the new campaign does not directly address the brand's reliability and quality concerns, it relies heavily on Mercedes' traditional reputation for durability. Many of the cars featured in the photographs are decades old.\n''Our authenticity, our heritage and the pride people have in Mercedes, those are all huge comparative advantages for us,'' said Ms. Cervantez, who once oversaw the Lincoln and Jaguar brands at the Ford Motor Company before joining Mercedes in March 2003.\nBut Ms. Cervantez is not depending solely on the image campaign to win over consumers.\nIn July, Mercedes will invite close to one million consumers in a dozen cities to take a Mercedes for a spin during an event-marketing program, the Love Mercedes Ride and Drive.THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; Mercedes owners get behind the wheel of a new campaign.", "Unidentified teenager is in critical condition after two men beat him with baseball bat in his Bronx (NYC) apartment (M)A teenager was in critical condition after two men beat him with a baseball bat in his Bronx apartment yesterday, the police and a neighbor said.\nThe victim was attacked about 3 p.m. in his first-floor apartment at 1020 Walton Avenue, said his upstairs neighbor, a 22-year-old who would identify herself only as Milagross. She identified the victim as Ralph Rodriguez.\nThe men beat him and pushed his head into a glass table, said Milagross, who said she helped the victim after his attackers fled.\nThe police did not identify the victim but said he was 15.

It occurred early Monday, not on Sunday.Corrections", "Sen John Kerry, presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, is longtime member of Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation and, as such, has been at nexus of some of most high-stakes lobbying in Washington over telecommunications and cable television policy; has also raised significant campaign money from corporate interests with stake in legislation; review of Kerry's record shows that over the years, he has intervened for home-state interests and donors like Bell Atlantic and its successor company, Verizon, on matters including cable television rates, access to new Internet markets and proposed airwave spectrum auction in which Verizon had about $1 billion stake; table shows top donors to Kerry since 1990 election cycle (L)A review of Mr. Kerry's record shows that over the years, he has intervened for home-state interests -- and donors -- like Bell Atlantic and its successor company, Verizon, on matters including cable television rates, access to new Internet markets and a proposed airwave spectrum auction in which Verizon had about $1 billion at stake. (Verizon was formed when Bell Atlantic and GTE merged and ultimately entered New York's long-distance market.)\nMr. Kerry has also at times taken positions favoring the interests of telecommunications and cable clients of the Boston law firm where his brother, Cameron F. Kerry, is a partner. The firm has been the senator's single biggest campaign donor over the course of his career, with its members pumping about $250,000 into his coffers since 1990, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan group that monitors fund-raising.\nYet at other times Mr. Kerry has taken positions at odds with the firm, Mintz, Levin, Cohn, Ferris, Glovsky & Popeo. He opposed extending tax breaks for broadband Internet service providers, for example, despite the fact that Mintz, Levin's clients were pushing for the extension.\nCongressional aides, former regulators and lobbyists familiar with Mr. Kerry's record say that unlike other senators who play a guiding role in telecommunications policies affecting billions of dollars of commerce, Mr. Kerry has not been a consistent ally of any particular cause or industry. Even his corporate donors describe his regulatory stances as unpredictable.\n''Some members of Congress pick what side they want to be on in the holy jihad of telecommunications policy,'' said Mr. Kennard, the former agency chairman. ''You never got that sense from John. He was above the fray.''\nMr. Kerry has not shied away from contacting the communications agency, sometimes on behalf of corporations and sometimes on behalf of consumers.\nMore than three dozen letters to the agency publicly available or provided to The New York Times by the Kerry campaign show that the senator sought to expedite the entry of Bell Atlantic into new Internet markets; to weigh in against the easing of cross-ownership restrictions in the media industry; and to help Massachusetts residents resolve problems with their phone bills.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nIn the case of the merger of Bell Atlantic and GTE, Michael Meehan, a senior campaign adviser to Mr. Kerry, said the senator had sought to help the merger along because Bell Atlantic ''was the biggest employer in the state.'' And after the merger went through, Mr. Kerry signed a letter to Verizon's management criticizing its hard-line approach to labor negotiations.\nAcross Mr. Kerry's career executives and employees from telecommunications and cable companies, as well as the lawyers who represent them, have been among his biggest donors. According to the Center for Responsive Politics, individuals employed by Verizon and its predecessor company, Bell Atlantic, for example, have contributed $70,418 to Mr. Kerry since 1990, making him the third-largest federal recipient of the company's largesse, behind George W. Bush ($119,980) and Senator John McCain ($71,200).\nThe same interests are also among his biggest presidential campaign fund-raisers. Tom Wheeler, former head of the wireless telephone industry's trade group and now a communications consultant, is a top fund-raiser for Mr. Kerry's campaign. Mr. Wheeler has brought in $50,000 to $100,000, according to figures the Kerry campaign released on Friday.\nBut because Mr. Kerry has refused throughout his Senate career to take donations from corporate political action committees, or P.A.C.'s -- until he formed one when beginning his presidential campaign -- he has not been a top Senate recipient of donations from the cable and telecommunications industries.\nBy and large, Mr. Kerry's record on issues the Commerce Committee regulates wins praise from consumer groups.\n''In general, John Kerry has been a very strong consumer advocate when it comes to telecommunications issues,'' said Gene Kimmelman, public policy director at Consumers Union, a consumer advocacy group.\nBut Mr. Kimmelman also offered a caveat regarding regulation of cable television prices, an issue that has been hard fought and heavily lobbied in Congress since the mid-1980's. ''When it came to cable he was not in favor of capping skyrocketing cable rates or promoting more competition among cable monopolies.''\nIn 1992 Congress was enmeshed in heated debate over regulating cable prices. Mr. Kerry co-sponsored an amendment at the time that would have undermined some of the rate caps the legislation sought to impose and would have retained programming advantages sought by big cable and content providers.\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\nThe amendment was also supported by one of Mr. Kerry's major corporate constituents, Continental Cablevision of Massachusetts -- also a donor. According to the Center for Responsive Politics, Continental Cablevision employees donated $11,375 to Mr. Kerry from 1989 to 1994, making the company the fifth-largest giver among media and entertainment concerns contributing money to the senator in that period.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nContinental Cablevision's interests in the 1992 act were advocated in Senate offices by Mintz, Levin, the law firm where Mr. Kerry's brother and his former chief of staff, David Leiter, work.\nCameron Kerry, a close adviser to his brother, said he has never lobbied the senator or his staff on legislative matters. Mr. Leiter, who has raised more than $100,000 for Mr. Kerry's campaign, said he tries to avoid contacting the senator's office.\nCharles Ferris, a former chairman of the Federal Communications Commission who founded Mintz, Levin's Washington office, said that ''never once did we ever approach John Kerry to introduce legislation on behalf of a client.''\nMintz, Levin did, however, take an active role in fighting increased regulation during the legislative brawl surrounding the 1992 Cable Act. After Mr. Kerry's amendment failed, he voted for the legislation that imposed rate caps.\nThen he joined several other senators in November 1993 in writing a letter to the F.C.C. asking it to closely monitor the 1992 act and ''take additional action to reduce cable rates and step up its enforcement activities to ensure that cable firms are not evading the letter and the spirit of the legislation passed last year.''\nMr. Kerry's Senate staff referred questions on his position on the rate cap to Timothy Todreas, Mr. Kerry's chief legislative aide on media and communications issues in the early 1990's. Mr. Todreas said the reason the senator co-sponsored the amendment was that he feared that the legislation's regulations would stifle the cable industry's growth and ''cripple the next great communications infrastructure.''\nA few years later, in the long run-up to passage of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, Mr. Kerry again maneuvered on cable's behalf to protect the industry from rate caps. He derided an amendment to the act that would have hindered efforts to undo some of the rate regulations imposed by the 1992 Cable Act.\n''I think all of us have learned that when you have regulation, you inevitably have a skewing of the market which impacts the capacity of people to take risks, people to raise capital, people to invest and diversify,'' Mr. Kerry said on June 15, 1995.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nFrom 1995 to 1996, Mr. Kerry received about $48,000 from executives and others affiliated with cable companies, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, making him the third-largest recipient of cable industry money in the Senate at the time.\nOn June 10, 1995 -- five days before the final Senate vote on the Telecommunications Act -- he also took in about $50,000 at a fund-raiser arranged for him by Robert Popeo, a partner at Mintz, Levin.\nHoward Symons, a Mintz, Levin lawyer, said that the fund-raiser had been scheduled long before the Senate vote was slated. Mr. Kerry's Senate and campaign staff maintain that money played no role in shaping the senator's opposition to the amendment and that his position was based on his regulatory philosophy.\nTwo years ago, Mr. Kerry again rallied on behalf of Verizon, helping the company with an issue in which it had a vital stake. In May 2002, he was one of 16 senators who signed a letter to the F.C.C. chairman, Michael K. Powell, on an impending auction of a portion of the wireless communications airwave spectrum. They advocated -- ultimately successfully -- a delay of the auction. The delay was sought by large cellular phone companies to avoid a bidding war that would have depleted their treasuries and enriched broadcasters who controlled parts of the spectrum.\nVerizon, for one, had more than $1 billion tied up in down payments on spectrum space, and wanted to be awarded the spectrum license or have the money refunded; what it did not want was an auction.\nMr. Kerry co-sponsored legislation seeking the auction's delay. The Cellular Telecommunications and Internet Association, the trade group representing large cellular companies, lobbied for the delay and Mintz, Levin represented its interests on Capitol Hill.\nTom Wheeler, who headed the trade association at the time, and is now a top Kerry fund-raiser, did not return repeated phone calls seeking comment. Mintz, Levin's Mr. Symons said ''it's possible that I may have had a passing conversation with Kerry's staff on that but I dealt extensively with other people's staffs who were really pushing the legislation.''\nNonetheless, it was not only wireless interests favoring a delay of the auction. Consumer groups also pushed for a delay, because they saw the auction as an unearned financial windfall for broadcasters -- thus placing Mr. Kerry, as he is often found, in both corporate and consumer camps on a single issue.\nMr. Kennard said of Mr. Kerry: ''A lot of lawmakers restate what they are given from lobbyists. I could often look at something and tell pretty quickly where it was coming from. You got that sense he rose above that.''In Fights Over Telecom Issues, Record Shows, Kerry's Worked on Many Sides", "BURNETT--Byron K. March 24, 2003. To my Daddy, my best friend, I miss you.

They contend that there were more rapes, robberies and other felonies in the city than have been made public.\nThey offered little evidence to support their claim, which was made as the city and the union have been battling over wages and the failure to reach a new contract for the force.\nThe assertion drew a stinging rebuke from Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, who, at his own news conference later in the day, suggested that in making such charges, the police union leadership was implicitly insulting its own members.\n''You can't have it both ways,'' he said, beginning his attack before a reporter could quite finish his question. ''You can't have a billboard in Times Square claiming you're doing such a great job and therefore need a raise, and then the same guy goes out on the steps of wherever he gave his press conference and claim that the success of the N.Y.P.D. is inflated.''\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nThe mayor continued, ''I'm a bigger advocate, a fan, of the members of the P.B.A. than apparently the union leadership is.''Union Leaders Allege Fudging Of Statistics On City Crime", "Op-Ed article by Yale Profs Ian Ayres and Barry Nalebuff points out that, of many ethical questions raised by Justice Anton Scalia's duck-hunting trip with Vice Pres Cheney, one is in his own memo explaining how he used only half of round-trip airline ticket to get back to Washington, in violation of airline fare rules; suggests Scalia may have to recuse himself if airline pricing case ever reaches Supreme Court (M)Of the many ethical questions raised by Justice Antonin Scalia's duck-hunting trip with Vice President Dick Cheney, one has actually been prompted by the justice himself: how is a law-abiding public servant supposed to get back to Washington from Louisiana?\nJustice Scalia had flown to Louisiana in January on the vice president's plane. But Mr. Cheney left before Justice Scalia did, so the justice and his relatives bought their own tickets home. In a 21-page memo explaining his decision not to recuse himself from a case involving the vice president, Justice Scalia wrote, ''We purchased (because they were the least expensive) round-trip tickets that cost precisely what we would have paid if we had gone both down and back on commercial flights.''\nIt may have been the right ethical decision as far as the vice president was concerned; as Justice Scalia later noted, ''None of us saved a cent by flying on the vice president's plane.'' But from the airline's standpoint, it was wrong. Justice Scalia and his family probably saved a bundle by misrepresenting their intentions.\nIn the topsy-turvy world of airline pricing, a round-trip ticket is often cheaper -- even much cheaper -- than a one-way fare. On US Airways, for example, a round-trip ticket between Washington and New Orleans could have been bought yesterday for as little as $198, while the cheapest unrestricted one-way fare was $638.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nJustice Scalia did not say how much he paid for his round-trip ticket, but it seems fair to assume that he bought what is known as a ''throw-away ticket'' -- something the airlines expressly prohibit. US Airways, for example, does not allow the ''use of round-trip excursion fares for one-way travel,'' and reserves the right to refuse to board those who try to use them and to charge them the difference between the round-trip and one-way fare.\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

They might want to -- and their advertisers might agree -- but they don't. Airlines, however, charge more for a one-way ticket because they know that some business travelers need the flexibility to buy such tickets, and are willing to pay more for it.\nOf course, maybe Justice Scalia plans to use the return half of his ticket later. If he does not, however, he in essence has admitted to buying a ticket under false pretenses. He made a promise without any intention of fulfilling it. Justice Scalia is no doubt familiar with the legal term for such an act: it's called promissory fraud.The Wrong Ticket to Ride", "Superior Court Judge Edward M Coleman will allow defense to show computerized video demonstrating how shotgun that killed former New Jersey Nets player Jayson Williams's chauffeur Costas Christofi could have malfunctioned; agrees with prosecution, however, that allowing jury to see Williams and his family in his home could evoke sympathy for Williams (M)The section of video Judge Coleman approved shows contrasting images of the firing mechanism in the Williams shotgun, which is 10 years old, and in a new gun of the same model. Defense lawyers say the mechanism on the Williams gun is slightly worn and rounded, and prone to misfiring, while the similar parts on the new one are pristine.\nA malfunction is a central element in the Williams defense. While prosecutors contend that Mr. Williams handled the gun recklessly and with extreme indifference to human life when he pointed it at the chauffeur, Costas Christofi, 55, the defense says the gun malfunctioned and fired accidentally when Mr. Williams jerked it upward to close its barrels.In refusing to dismiss two manslaughter charges and two weapons charges against Mr. Williams, Judge Coleman focused on the testimony of Kent Culuko, a close friend of Mr. Williams's, and Benoit Benjamin, his former teammate on the Nets.\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Mr. Culuko's and Mr. Benjamin's descriptions of the shooting were the most incriminating. They said they heard Mr. Williams curse at Mr. Christofi as he snapped the gun closed while the chauffeur was standing a few feet from him. They said the gun fired the instant it shut.\nOther guests in the bedroom and adjoining study said they heard no cursing before the shotgun blast.\nDuring cross-examination, the defense challenged the accounts of both Mr. Culuko and Mr. Benjamin. One defense lawyer, William R. Martin, called Mr. Benjamin a liar.\nJudge Coleman alluded to contradictory witness testimony on Tuesday, saying that it was the jury's role, and not his, to determine which witnesses were credible and what testimony was truthful.\nDefense lawyers said they wanted the jury to tour the Williams home, in part, to help them sort out testimony about where Mr. Williams, Mr. Christofi and the various houseguests were standing at the moment of the fatal shot.\nIn barring the visit, Judge Coleman said the jury could rely on pictures and diagrams already in evidence to address that issue. He also said if a visit were allowed, jurors might see Mr. Williams's wife, Tanya, or their 1-year-old daughter. The judge was also concerned that they might see photographs or memorabilia of Mr. Williams's basketball career. Seeing his family or possessions, the judge said, could make some jurors ''feel a personal connection'' with Mr. Williams and later base their verdict on sympathy and not evidence.Judge Allows Williams Defense to Show Video, but Not Home", "Federal Judge Lyle E Strom who heard cattle-pricing case brought against Tyson Foods declines to approve jury's suggested to $1.2 billion judgment against cattle processor; also refuses to impose prejudgment interest award sought by plaintiffs, who represented class of cattle producers (S)The federal judge who heard a cattle-pricing case brought against Tyson Foods declined last week to approve the jury's suggested $1.2 billion judgment against the cattle processor.\nThe judge, Lyle E. Strom of Federal District Court, ruled that the number ''clearly overstates defendant's liability.'' He also refused to impose a prejudgment interest award sought by the plaintiffs, who represented a class of cattle producers.\nThe case, which was tried earlier this year in Montgomery, Ala., centered on accusations that a company Tyson had acquired had violated the federal Packers and Stockyards Act by depressing the cash market price for fed cattle over an eight-year period.\nBut in a March 19 ruling, which Tyson disclosed on Tuesday, Judge Strom repeated a position he had taken during the trial -- that he would not enter a monetary judgment on a verdict, ''as there was no way to distinguish between damages suffered by all sellers on the cash market and damages suffered solely by class members'' who had brought the lawsuit.\nJudge Strom said in his ruling that the $1.2 billion suggested by the jury included damages suffered by producers who were not represented.Judge Rejects Tyson Penalty", "Kelefa Sanneh reviews concert by Dave Brubeck and resurrected 1946 octet; photo (M)''I never expected to be here playing this, or to ever hear this music again,'' Dave Brubeck said. He was addressing a full house at Avery Fisher Hall on Monday night, and the grandfatherly twinkle in his eye made it plain that he took pleasure in adding another unlikely chapter to an unlikely career.\nThe concert resurrected his 1946 octet, a group he formed at Mills College while studying with the composer Darius Milhaud. Mr. Brubeck, and his bandmates explored unusual forms and rhythms, and their experiments anticipated some of the directions jazz would take in the decades that followed. But the music was nearly lost: as Mr. Brubeck explained, the scores were destroyed in a flood, and so on Monday night the musicians worked from transcriptions of an old recording.\nSo this was a night of cheerful reversals. The venerable master, now 83, reprised the role of eager student, wistfully recalling Milhaud's influence. The group played music that had gone from the printed page to the stage and -- painstakingly -- back again. And the audience got a chance to hear old avant-garde compositions that prefigured a future now past.\nNine musicians and a conductor were required to recreate the complicated arrangements, including the four members of the Dave Brubeck quartet (which played a nimble, spirited set to open the show) and William O. Smith, the adventurous clarinetist who was a key member of the original octet.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nOne of the most appealing pieces was Mr. Brubeck's densely interwoven setting of ''The Way You Look Tonight.'' He warned the audience that it was ''very complicated,'' sometimes shifting harmony with every beat, but the group scampered through the changes as if the whole thing were merely a lark.\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Of course he eventually found other uses for the hybrid jazz-rondo form. A decade later Milhaud's challenge inspired one of Mr. Brubeck's best-known compositions, ''Blue Rondo a la Turk.''\nAnother hybrid, ''Fugue on Bop Themes,'' still sounded weird and witty all these years later.

Restore the Guest Book\nBIDDLE-David., M.D. The Department of Neurology and the Staff Society of the Long Island Jewish Medical Center mourn the loss of our dear and respected colleague, Dr. David Biddle. Dr. Biddle has been an integral part of the department and staff for nearly 34 years. He first came to Long Island Jewish Medical Center in 1970 as an intern. He completed his Neurology Residency under Dr. Morton Nathanson, who held him in the highest regards for the next three decades. Dr. Biddle held numerous clinical and administrative positions in the department and medical center, including Staff Society President, but most importantly, he was recognized for his unfailing clinical dedication and devotion to the teaching of residents. Even as illness sapped his strength, he maintained an active role in caring for his patients and nurturing the neurological careers of house officers and junior faculty. His brilliance and intense spirit had an impact on many, and will forever remain alive for, and through his wife Trisha and his two children, Erika and Jeremy. A memorial will be held at The Village Club, at Lake Success, 318 Lakeville Road on Sunday, March 28, from 12:002:00 PM. As per Dr. Biddle's wishes, in lieu of flowers or food, contributions in his memory may be made to The Dr. David Biddle Wish Fund.

Restore the Guest Book\nMACIAG-Thomas, PhD., internationally recognized molecular and cell biologist, died March 8, 2004 in Freeport, ME, at 57. Dr. Maciag was a scientist of the highest distinction, with extraordinary intellect, keen insight and an artist's vision of how complex biological systems work. He made seminal contributions in angiogenesis. His discovery of fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) led him to be the first to propagate human endothelial cells in vitro for long periods of time and to identify many genes for angiogenic behavior. The generation of scientists he mentored in the fields of angiogenesis, growth factor biology, proteases, cell growth and development were profoundly affected by his aggressive and fearless approach to science. Born in 1946 in Bayonne, NJ, he earned a B.A. from Rutgers University in 1968, and served in the U.S. Army Medical Corps from 1969 to 1971. He earned his Ph.D. in Molecular Biology and Biochemistry from the University of Pennsylvania in 1975 and did postdoctoral study there. Highlights from his career include appointment as Assistant Professor of Pathology, Harvard Medical School in 1980 and work as Head of the Department of Molecular Biology, American Red Cross, Rockville, MD with teaching at George Washington University. In 1997 he accepted the challenge to establish the Center for Molecular Medicine at Maine Medical Center Research Institute (MMCRI). NIH recognized his success with an $11 million award for a Center of Biomedical Research Excellence in angiogenesis. Dr. Maciag was Scientific Director of MMCRI and Presidential Professor of the Biomedical Sciences, University of Maine. He published over 150 scientific articles, earned many patents, and received numerous awards for his contributions to science. He was an accomplished artist whose interpretations of cellular function were featured on the covers of scientific journals. Tom is survived by his wife, Lorrie, and son, Andrei, of Freeport, ME, his parents, Edward and Agnes Maciag, and sister, Arlene Arzulowicz, of Sommerville, NJ. A memorial service will be held at MMCRI, Scarborough, ME, March 26, 2004, 2-5 P.M.

To synthesize their knowledge, students write monologues from the perspectives of Palestinian and Israeli students, imagining their opinions or experiences of some of the events included in the timeline.Note: This lesson was originally published on an older version of The Learning Network; the link to the related Times article will take you to a page on the old site.\nOverview of Lesson Plan: In this lesson, students discuss the roles that morality and pragmatism play in war, and then create a timeline documenting Israel\u2019s evolving response to terrorism since 1948. To synthesize their knowledge, students write monologues from the perspectives of Palestinian and Israeli students, imagining their opinions or experiences of some of the events included in the timeline.\nAuthor(s):\nSierra Prasada Millman, The New York Times Learning Network\nJavaid Khan, The Bank Street College of Education in New York City\nSuggested Time Allowance: 1 hour\nObjectives:\nStudents will:\n1. Analyze the conflicting roles that morality and pragmatism play in war.\n2. Study the most recent Israeli response to terrorism, the killing of Sheik Ahmed Yassin, by reading and discussing the article \u201cDeath of Sheik Raises Question of Hamas Fate.\u201d\n3. Research and create a timeline documenting Israel\u2019s evolving response to terrorism since its statehood in 1948.\n4. Prepare monologues that take the perspectives of Israeli and Palestinian students, in which they imagine the characters\u2019 opinions and experiences of specific events included in the timeline.\nResources / Materials:\n-pens/pencils\n-classroom blackboard\n-eight large pieces of paper\n-four markers\n-index cards with small group instructions, as explained in the Warm-Up activity\n-tape or push pins\n-copies of the article \u201cDeath of Sheik Raises Question of Hamas Fate\u201d (one per student)\n-resources for researching the Israeli response to terrorism since 1948 (textbooks and library resources, computers with Internet access)\nActivities / Procedures:\n1. WARM-UP/DO-NOW: Prior to class, arrange desks into four groups, and place a large piece of paper and a marker at each grouping. At two of the groupings of desks, place an index card with the following instructions written on it:\nYour group represents a minority population in your country. You are waging a war against the government and a foreign power that has intervened on behalf of the status quo (the existing way that life is lived in your country). Generate a list of your group\u2019s likely objectives and suggest possible strategies by which you will most likely achieve those aims. Record your thoughts on the piece of paper provided to create a \u201cstrategy poster.\u201d\nAt the other two groupings of desks, place an index card with the following instructions written on it:\nYou represent a government that has been waged war upon by a minority group in your country. A foreign power has intervened on your behalf. Generate a list of your group\u2019s likely objectives and suggest possible strategies by which you will most likely achieve those aims. Record your thoughts on the piece of paper provided to create a \u201cstrategy poster.\u201d Consider whether the government\u2019s and the foreign power\u2019s objectives and strategies differ from each other.\nAllow groups about fifteen minutes to respond to their instructions. Groups should hang their posters around the room and present their posters to the class in order to compare and contrast responses. Then, ask students to consider the morality and practicality of the actions advocated by each group. Students should give examples (and explain their reasons) of actions they consider moral, actions they consider immoral, actions they consider pragmatic and actions they consider most likely to be effective. Record each list on the board and encourage students to draw conclusions about the conflicting roles that morality and pragmatism play in war. Other questions to stimulate discussion include:\n\u2013What role do the general circumstances that inspired the combatants\u2019 aims (oppression, poverty, lack of resources, etc.) play in shaping the perceived morality of their actions? Can the same action be moral in one circumstance and immoral in another? Why or why not?\n\u2013Under what circumstances, if any, does pragmatism trump morality? Under what circumstances, if any, does morality trump pragmatism?\n\u2013Would an intervening foreign power be subject to different moral guidelines than the in-country combatants? Why or why not?\n2. As a class, read and discuss the article \u201cDeath of Sheik Raises Question of Hamas Fate,\u201d focusing on the following questions:\na. Who was Sheik Ahmed Yassin?\nb. What \u201cwager\u201d did Israel engage by killing Sheik Yassin, according to the article?\nc. What impact have \u201ctwo years of systematic Israeli raids against Hamas and other violent Palestinian groups\u201d had on suicide bombings and Israeli deaths?\nd. How have Palestinians responded to the Sheik\u2019s death?\ne. How does Boaz Ganor, head of the International Policy Institute for Counter-Terrorism in Israel, suggest the Sheik\u2019s killing has influenced Hamas\u2019s \u201coverall capacity to deliver attacks\u201d and \u201cmotivation\u201d?\nf. How does he predict the killing will affect Hamas in the long term?\ng. How does Mr. Ganor describe Sheik Yassin\u2019s role in Hamas?\nh. How, in 2000, did Sheik Yassin predict that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict would eventually conclude?\ni. What kind of man was Sheik Yassin (appearance, voice, social habits, etc.), according to the article?\nj. How prominent a role does Hamas play in suicide bombings, according to the article?\nk. Did Palestinians consider Sheik Yassin a political or a military figure in Hamas, according to the article? Did Israelis agree? Why or why not?\nl. What power did Hamas\u2019s \u201clarge following and its ability to carry out bombings consistently\u201d give it, according to the article?\nm. Which two Israeli officials opposed the operation? What reason did Avraham Poraz, the Israeli interior minister, give for his opposition?\nn. What \u201csimilar wager in 1996\u2033 do opponents draw again to critique the operation? How did Hamas respond to that operation?\no. When did Israel begin attacking top Hamas political figures?\np. Who is Ziad Abu Amr? What did he suggest about Sheik Yassin and the operation? Why does Mr. Ganor disagree?\nq. What is Sheik Yassin\u2019s personal history?\n3. Explain to students that each of their groups will be contributing to a timeline documenting the history of Israel\u2019s evolving response to terrorism since its statehood in 1948. Assign group to cover fourteen years (1948 \u2013 1962, 1962 \u2013 1976, 1976 \u2013 1990, and 1990 \u2013 2004). First, using all available classroom resources, each group should consider the following questions for each terrorist event in Israel in their time period and Palestinian and Israeli responses (written on the board for easier student access):\n\u2013Who were the major players, both Palestinian and Israeli?\n\u2013What motivated the terrorists? What were their objectives?\n\u2013What roles did civilians, soldiers, political officials and other organizations (both Israeli and Palestinian) play in the incident and responses?\n\u2013What motivated the Israeli (or other) response to terrorism?\n\u2013What kind of collateral damage did the terrorist incident and/or responses cause?\n\u2013How did the incident impact the developing peace process, if at all? Why?\nAfter research is complete, each group should create a timeline on a large piece of paper. Give students time at the end of class to make one timeline out of the four, read and take notes from it, and ask questions.\n4. WRAP-UP/HOMEWORK: To synthesize the classroom activities, each student in each group should select a different incident from his or her group\u2019s timeline and write a monologue from the perspective of an Israeli or a Palestinian student with regards to that incident. In the monologue, the student should imagine the character\u2019s opinions and experiences of the specific event. Monologues should be performed in a later class.\nFurther Questions for Discussion:\n\u2013Does the article imply that the \u201ctwo years of systematic Israeli raids\u201d directly contributed to the decrease in suicide bombings and Israeli deaths? Do you find the claim persuasive? Why or why not?\n\u2013Do you agree with the argument that Sheik Yassin may be \u201cirreplaceable\u201d? Are leaders ever irreplaceable?\n\u2013Is the killing made \u201cworse\u201d by the Sheik\u2019s status as a quadriplegic? Why or why not?\n\u2013If the Sheik was not directly involved in planning attacks, did he still, as the spiritual leader of Hamas, bear responsibility for its killings?\n\u2013Why have Hamas\u2019s (and other organizations\u2019) suicide bombings threatened to derail the peace process in Israel? Is there a way for Israeli political officials to limit their influence, even if they are unable to stop the violence?\n\u2013Considering the impact of the 1996 killing of Yahya Ayyash, what influence could the Sheik\u2019s killing have on future Israeli politics and life?\n\u2013Why might Israel have previously refrained from targeting Hamas\u2019s \u201ctop political figures\u201d? What do you think motivated the change?\n\u2013Sentenced to life in prison, Yassin was then freed in an exchange of prisoners. Are such exchanges just? Are they effective? What is the reasoning behind them?\nEvaluation / Assessment:\nStudents will be evaluated based on participation in the initial task and subsequent class discussion, contribution to the timeline, and thoughtful completion of the monologue.\nVocabulary:\nSheik, Hamas, wagering, faction, retaliate, revenge, generated, surge, retaliatory, slain, strategic, absolutist, rasp, frailties, prominence, founder, Islamic, identified, distinguish, division, authorizing, initiating, archterrorist, negotiations, disrupt, derail, electoral, maintained, core, constituency, assassination, militant, ultraradical, sketchy, erupted\nExtension Activities:\n1. Write a response paper after viewing the New York Times slide show \u201cPalestinian Reaction,\u201d found at //www.nytimes.com/2004/03/23/international/middleeast/23YASS.html. Let the following questions guide your response:\n\u2013How do the photographs characterize the Palestinian response to the Sheik\u2019s death? Is the word \u201cmourning\u201d appropriate? Why or why not?\n\u2013What about the Jordanian response? Why might the citizens of other Arab countries be upset by the Sheik\u2019s death?\n\u2013Were there any women protesters represented in the photos? Why do you think that is?\n\u2013What symbols of oppression and resistance are included in the photographs? Are they effective? Why or why not?\n\u2013What might a Palestinian think and feel on seeing these photographs?\n\u2013What might an Israeli think and feel?\n\u2013What do you think and feel?\n2. Create a collage that represents, in images and brief text, the following statement: \u201cOne man\u2019s terrorist is another man\u2019s freedom fighter.\u201d Most images should clearly represent either \u201cterrorism\u201d or \u201cfreedom fighting.\u201d When finished, write one paragraph relating your response to the statement and explaining how the collage reflects your opinion.\n3. Draw and label your own series of trading cards, each card representing a major player in the history of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict since 1948 (such as Menachem Begin, Yasser Arafat, Bill Clinton, etc.) Include for each a photograph, a brief description of his or her role in the conflict, and a noteworthy quotation.\n4. Write a position paper that either defends or refutes government-sponsored assassinations. Consider the direct or indirect roles that the United States and other countries have played in such actions and their impact. Are such killings morally justifiable? Are they strategically sound? Why or why not? Provide and analyze specific examples of leaders who were assassinated, leaders who escaped assassination, and/or leaders who were provided with exile.\nInterdisciplinary Connections:\nAmerican History- Construct a chart that documents American presidential responses to and interventions in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict since 1948 and assesses their individual contributions. Which presidents were the most involved? Which presidents were the least involved? What steps did they take? Were they successful? Why or why not?\nCivics- Compose two letters that an American and an Israeli soldier might have written to each other, relating their unique experience of the Iraq war and service in the occupied territories, respectively. The correspondence needs to provide the reader with enough information to encourage an authentic comparison/contrast of American and Israeli military service. Students may want to consult the official Web sites of the Israeli Defense Forces (//www.idf.il) and the United States Army (//www.army.mil/).\nMedia Studies- Create a presentation comparing coverage of the Sheik\u2019s killing in American, French, Israeli and Palestinian media. Consider the different perspectives taken by journalists, subjects interviewed, events included, and photographs or graphics. Students will want to visit the NewsDirectory at //www.ecola.com and the official Web site of Al Jazeera (//english.aljazeera.net/HomePage).\nJournalism- Imagine that you have the opportunity to interview Sheik Yassin after his death. What questions might you ask him? How might he respond? Transcribe a fictional interview, soliciting the Sheik\u2019s opinion in the Israeli-Palestinian crisis, the United States, the afterlife, and his reaction to the funeral.\nTechnology- Design an interactive Web site that educates visitors on the history of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. How might the site inform and entertain simultaneously? Would it include a flash timeline, quizzes, links, etc.? Be creative. Provide a few examples of the specific content of each page.\nAcademic Content Standards:\nGrades 6-8\nWorld History Standard 43- Understands how post-World War II reconstruction occurred, new international power relations took shape, and colonial empires broke up.

Many have organized around the country in groups that offer support and a social circuit. At least in New York City, some cross-dressers feel comfortable enough to go out as women to restaurants, theaters and stores.\nAnd a whole network of businesses and services, run by both men and women, cater to these men's needs -- from instructional videos, discussion groups and Web sites that offer ''virtual makeovers'' to establishments that function as schools to teach the ABC's of the femme look and comportment.\nOne of them, Miss Erica's Finishing School & Cross-Dressing Academy in Columbus, Ohio, promises assistance with ''attitude and movement.'' Another, CrissCross Consultants in Houston, offers accompanied outings and ''glamour photography.'' And FemmeFever on Long Island says its mission is ''to unleash your femme side.''\nAt Fairplay, customers come to buy pumps up to size 17, get makeovers, manicures and beauty salon services, or pretend to be a bride and have wedding pictures taken.

''The walking. How to bend down to pick something up. All these things are so different. It's a continuous learning experience because you keep reverting to your natural way.''\nMr. Gorski, a 55-year-old gay man who said he learned his trade impersonating Judy Garland and Liza Minnelli in his youth, uses such tricks as giving a client very long nails so he is forced to grab a fork more delicately. He also teaches them how to take little steps and small bites, how to sit with legs together, how to ask for a drink in a soft pitch and then sip it through a straw, how to keep from ''waddling around'' a room or ''thumping'' up the stairs.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nThe goal for many is to pass for women, he said, but passing is a relative concept.\n''It's for your own head,'' Mr. Gorski said. ''It's how you feel.''\nRoom after room on the first floor of Mr. Gorski's cozy Victorian is taken up by floor-to-ceiling racks of women's clothing, glass cases of accessories in larger sizes and products to help reshape a male body into that of a woman -- from silicon breast forms to punishing corsets.

Mr. Gorski charges $150 an hour for full makeovers, including pictures, and another $30 an hour to chaperone outings. Adding purchases, a client can easily spend $300 to $400 on a single visit.\nA native of Staten Island, Mr. Gorski said he opened Fairplay in 1992 after his companion of 15 years died of AIDS and fear of the disease drove customers away from a hair salon the two of them owned. His neighbors know about the business and do not bother him, he said.\nMr. Gorski said he cross-dressed for the glamour and theatrics of transforming himself into a woman. He said that many of his clients were straight men seeking a refuge where they can cross-dress without fear of being found out or who are confused about their feelings and want to try out a feminine persona.\nClients like Samantha and Melissa say their need to cross-dress is not optional. Samantha, the New York advertising executive, said he cross-dressed ''to fulfill what I want to be.'' Divorced, he said he dated women but described himself as gender dysphoric, a condition in which someone feels trapped in the body of the opposite sex.\n''There's another part of my personality, a feminine part, that wants to come through,'' Samantha said as his arms were being waxed. ''It's not that the guy isn't there. But there's a whole flip side.''\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nMelissa said he found cross-dressing erotic and exciting, something he would not share with his wife.\n''I don't think she would understand,'' he said. ''It's the house, the kids, the dogs. This is totally out of the box.''\nSome wives and girlfriends are indeed horrified by cross-dressing, but there are those who accept it.\n''To slam the door in denial is not going to carry much water in the long run,'' said a woman whose husband is a top official of a national organization for heterosexual cross-dressers and spouses known as Tri-Ess, for the Society for the Second Self, which has about 1,400 members. ''This is the same person, and you still love each other.''\nShe said she learned of her husband's interest in cross-dressing 10 years into their marriage. Her husband, a 55-year-old doctor, says it has nothing to do with sex, but with the ability to let go of the burden of some of the responsibilities imposed on men.\nBut if not the least accepted, they are the least understood of transgender groups, some cross-dressers say.\n''The big issue is how to go from one life to the other without tension,'' said the president of a New York City group called Crossdressers International, who identified himself by his female name, Rochelle Nicole. ''The issues of wife, job and family are still big problems.''\nThose issues can go away, or at least recede, temporarily as the male gives way to the female in self-expression. On the recent Tuesday night at Fairplay, after three and a half hours of laborious primping, Samantha and Melissa were ready to go to the dance club with Mr. Gorski and a Fairplay employee known as Vanessa. Samantha wore hot pink boots, a black miniskirt and a sleeveless lacy fuchsia top (after Mr. Gorski had nixed a black top with a skeptical ''With these boots?''), all under an exuberant white wig. Melissa looked like a very tall Cher.\nAt the Colosseum nightclub in Sayreville, N.J., they fit right in on ''Tuesday Drag Attack'' night, blending with other cross-dressers and the drag queens participating in a lip-synching contest.

After participating in the shoot-around, the left knee injury that had kept him out of the previous three games seemed healed enough to allow him to take the court. But 10 minutes before tip-off, his outlook changed, and although his teammates were able to beat the visiting Hawks, 96-84, without him, what was left of his optimism vanished by Tuesday.\n''I'm willing to delay as long as it takes to get better, whether it's two games or even if it is the end of the season,'' he said.

Alan Cowell (NYT)World Business Briefing | Europe: Britain: Harry Potter And The Publisher's Profit", "African mining companies, governments of developing countries and international banks express concern over proposal that World Bank restrict oil and coal projects to protect environment; African governments that are heavily dependent on oil and mineral extraction fear new proposals could harm future investment; proposal came in form of report drafted by Emil Salim, former environmental minister from Indonesia who was appointed to prepare it in 2001 by World Bank president James D Wolfensohn; photo (M)But Dr. Salim, the report's author, has not abandoned those elements of the report and is continuing to seek support for them.\nThe report has reignited a debate over the benefits to developing countries versus the environmental toll of mining and oil extraction. On one side are groups that have long argued that mineral and oil projects in the developing world pollute and foster corruption; on the other are the mining companies and governments of many poor countries, which say that exploiting natural resources can help raise people out of harsh poverty. Several Nobel laureates -- led by Archbishop Desmond Tutu of South Africa, Jody Williams, Sir Joseph Rotblat, Betty Williams, Rigoberta Mench\u00fa Tum and Mairead Maguire -- have thrown the weight of their names to the environmental side, advocating the report's complete adoption, including its proposed phaseout of oil and coal projects, in a letter to the World Bank in February.\n''These oil and coals projects are not proven to alleviate poverty,'' said Jon Sohn, a senior policy analyst for Friends of the Earth in Washington, which also favors adoption of the review's findings.\n''There's a misconception or misinformation campaign inside the bank that this is really just about some environmental groups that are trying to push an agenda,'' Mr. Sohn said. ''With people like Desmond Tutu speaking out, they're finding this is a global issue.''\nIn his report, Dr. Salim found that mining and oil projects could contribute to development but only if certain environmental and social conditions were met.\nIt criticized World Bank projects in Colombia and Ecuador, for example, saying that mining supported by the bank had fouled land owned by indigenous peoples and had led to a weakening of their legal rights. But it also pointed out that some resource-rich countries like Botswana -- the world's largest diamond exporter -- had used the proceeds of their mineral wealth to benefit its people.\nMost controversially, Dr. Salim argued that, in order to uphold its commitment to sustainable development, the bank had an obligation to promote clean energy by ending its financing of coal and oil projects.\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

If the World Bank wants to focus on reducing poverty through sustainable development, he said, then it needs to address overreliance on oil and support renewable energy sources.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nThe bank's management was expected to respond to the report by April or May, but that response has been delayed to give it more time to evaluate the report. Later this year, the bank's directors -- who represent the bank's 184-member nations -- will determine which elements should become policy.\nThe stakes, say those involved, are far greater than the bank's direct financing of oil and mineral projects; the bank has enormous power to set standards for the financial industry as a whole. Twenty of the world's major banks have agreed to uphold the environmental and social standards set by the World Bank's International Finance Corporation under an agreement called the Equator Principles.\nThe World Bank directly finances only a small percentage of the world's oil and mining projects, primarily through the International Finance Corporation, its private-sector lending arm.\nSince 1980, mining and oil have accounted for 4 percent of the bank's lending and project support and averaged about $800 million a year, mostly for oil-related projects. Africa gets a small share of that, but some projects on the continent, including a $3.7 billion oil pipeline in Chad partly financed by the bank, have been among the organization's most controversial.\nThe pipeline, which began operations last year, was built by Exxon Mobil, Petronas of Malaysia, and ChevronTexaco, and its financing came with strings attached: the oil revenues have to be transparent, and the money used to improve the lot of Chad's people. Environmental and development groups, however, have accused the companies of not fulfilling their promises, like building schools, and that Chad's government has used money from the project to buy arms.\nSpecific recommendations of the report included the creation of zones deemed environmentally sensitive where no bank financing would be allowed, a ban on projects that dump waste into rivers, and new regulations to minimize the cyanide and mercury used in gold and platinum mining. The review also calls for the bank to get approval from local communities before financing any mining project.\n''The problem is that the recommendations for coal and gold and also for other industries are so onerous as to be unachievable,'' said Frans Barker, a senior executive of the Chamber of Mines of South Africa, which has taken a stance against the Salim review along with mining groups from other southern African countries. South Africa is the world's largest gold and platinum producer and the second-largest coal exporter. And more than 90 percent of its locally produced energy is coal based.\nThe World Bank's director for oil, gas and chemicals, Rashad Kaldany, who met with the African mining and energy ministers in Cape Town, defended the bank's projects in those areas and said that they were generally better managed and cleaner than privately financed ones.\nBut he added that the World Bank's management supported most of the review's findings.\n''We certainly feel that a large number of recommendations we can work with, live with and recommend to the board,'' he said. ''I think that's been lost because of this issue about oil and coal.''Proposal to Limit Oil and Coal Projects Draws Fire", "Trial is to beginin Los Angeles to determine whether Jewish couple Michael and Marla Sklar can deduct cost of religious education for their five children, tax benefit they say federal government has granted to members of just one religion, Church of Scientology; potential ramifications are huge, for ruling in favor of couple could affect millions of Americans who send their children to religious schools of all types; at stake is whether people of all religions can deduct cost of religious education as charitable gift, as Scientologists are allowed to do under officiallysecret 1993 agreement with Internal Revenue Service; photo (M)''Why is Scientology training different from all other religious training?'' Judge Barry D. Silverman wrote in his opinion, adding that the question would not be answered just then because the court was not faced with the question of whether ''members of the Church of Scientology have become the I.R.S.'s chosen people.'' Judge Silverman then recommended litigation to address whether the government is improperly favoring one religion.\n''If the I.R.S. does in fact give preferential treatment to members of the Church of Scientology -- allowing them a special right to claim deductions that are contrary to law and disallowed to everybody else -- then the proper course of action is a lawsuit to put a stop to that policy,'' Judge Silverman wrote.\nIn this second trial, also against the I.R.S. and involving $3,209 of taxes for 1995, the Sklars are represented by Jeffrey I. Zuckerman of Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Colt & Mosle in Washington, who is serving pro bono.\nThe chief tax lawyer for the Church of Scientology, Monique E. Yingling, said the Sklar lawsuit was baseless. She said that until the 1993 agreement, Scientologists were discriminated against by not being allowed to take charitable deductions.\n''Scientologists now are being treated the same as everyone else, Catholics, Mormons, Hindus,'' she said, her list of religions continuing.\n''Auditing and training are both Scientology religious services,'' Ms. Yingling said, that members ''participate in to advance in Scientology.''\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

He said that were he a Scientologist, it was clear he could deduct these sums.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nWhen the Sklars tried to take the deduction, the I.R.S. sent them letters laying out the terms for Scientologists to take such deductions. The I.R.S. then denied the deductions because the Sklars did not provide receipts from the Church of Scientology.\nOther than the Sklars, the only known legal challenge to the I.R.S. agreement with the Scientologists was made by the nonprofit publisher of Tax Notes magazine. It tried unsuccessfully to get a judge to make the agreement public. (Copies of what seem to be the agreement were leaked several years ago.)\n''The reason I got started on this course of action was I felt that there was a precedent being set that is extremely dangerous,'' Mr. Sklar said. ''If the government is allowed to do this unchallenged, it means you have a state-favored religion, and that has never fared well for the Jews.''\nMr. Sklar said that after he pressed his claim for a charitable deduction, the I.R.S. audited him and eight clients. ''I think the I.R.S. was harassing me because before I had maybe one audit in two years,'' he said.\nA subpoena for the secret agreement with the Scientologists has been quashed at the request of the Church of Scientology and the I.R.S. A fight over access to that agreement is likely to be a crucial issue on appeal, which seems certain regardless of how the trial judge rules.\nMr. Sklar said that after more than a decade of tax breaks for Scientologists, he believed that the only proper course for the courts was to allow people of all faiths to take charitable deductions for the costs of religious education and training.\nBut Judge Silverman, who had urged litigation to settle the issue, took a different approach in his opinion two years ago.\n''The remedy,'' he wrote, ''is not to require the I.R.S. to let others claim the improper deduction.''Scientologists' Tax Break Cited in Suit Against I.R.S.", "Vanderbilt University prepares for NCAA tournament Round of 16 game against Connecticut University; photos (M)After all, Vanderbilt never seemed to get the bounces. This was the university that had Bear Bryant as the football team's defensive line coach in the early 1940's but could not keep him. Bill Parcells was defensive coordinator at Vanderbilt in the mid-70's, but he was never hired as a head coach. Mike Krzyzewski was considered for head coach for the men's basketball team when he was at Army in 1979, but the job went to Richard Schmidt, who was fired two years later.\nStill, the only private university in the conference -- and the smallest member of the S.E.C., with fewer than 6,000 undergraduates -- insisted on playing by its ideals. Vanderbilt had the first African-American basketball player in the S.E.C., routinely led the nation in graduation rates and rejected one of the best high school players in Nashville history, Ron Mercer, because his grades were not good enough. After the outcry subsided, Mercer went to Kentucky and left early for the N.B.A.\n''Vanderbilt teams have always drawn on the energy and the juices of the underdog role,'' said Perry Wallace, who became the first African-American basketball player in S.E.C. history in 1967-68. ''I appreciate that they are always taking the lead on reforms. They have a constant desire to move things forward because they understand who they are, how the odds are stacked against them, and they let those odds be inspiring.''\nAround the corner from Music Row and up the street from the honky-tonks lining Broadway, Vanderbilt has fit right in with a town that sings about struggle and glorifies the little guy. In a league that prizes football over all else, the Commodores' greatest gridiron accomplishments came before the forward pass. The men's basketball team has historically been competitive, but only last season it lost by 62 points at Kentucky, dropped nine games in a row and was pressured to fire Stallings.\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Bob Ryan, a sports columnist for The Boston Globe, proclaimed on the radio that Vanderbilt could not win a game in the tournament because it had ''too many white guys.'' The ensuing back-and-forth between Ryan and offended Vanderbilt fans could have filled the Commodores' bulletin board.\nWith three African-American starters and no athletic director, Vanderbilt blew out Western Michigan and came back from a double-digit deficit in the final three minutes to upset North Carolina State last Sunday. When the team arrived back on campus, nearly 1,000 people were waiting with the temperature in the 30's to greet them.\n''This entire campus erupted,'' said Richard McCarty, dean of the College of Arts and Science, who was among the faculty members in the cold. ''I could hear people yelling and screaming out of their dorms. With all the bad news in college sports, this is a shining example of how you can have athletics and academics in a proper way. We're very proud of it.''\nOnce known as the center for the Southern literary movement in the 1920's, Vanderbilt is currently recognized for straddling the narrowest lines in college sports. It patterns itself not after Duke and Stanford, or Alabama and Auburn, but attempts to adopt elements of each. In the past year, Vanderbilt has been ranked among the top 25 universities in the country by U.S. News & World Report (No. 20), was No. 24 in Playboy's ''Top 25 Party Schools'' and has both its men's and women's basketball teams in the Round of 16.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nNo colleges are rushing to deconstruct their athletic departments and pattern themselves after Vanderbilt, but given recent scandals involving universities like Colorado and Georgia, and recent developments for the Commodores' basketball team, Vanderbilt's strategy is at least gaining some credibility.\n''We did this because we had started seeing athletic departments around the country as silos separate from the university,'' said David Williams II, vice chancellor for student life and university affairs and the man who now oversees athletics.\nWilliams said that Vanderbilt encouraged athletes to run for student government, write for the student newspaper and become officers in their dorms.\n''No matter what they say in mission statements, athletic departments were not integrated into the mission of the university and were drifting further away,'' Williams said. ''We noticed symptoms of that here. We wanted to make athletics truly part of the university and say to our student-athletes, 'We value you as more than just athletes.' We are not doing away with athletics at all.

But administration officials have yet to propose any specific legislation, and Republicans in Congress, who are deeply divided over the proposal, say it is unlikely that a major immigration bill will pass in this election year.\nAdministration officials told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee at a hearing on Tuesday that the president was unlikely to back any other immigration bills pending in Congress, including bipartisan legislation intended to provide legal status to some illegal farm workers and certain groups of students.\nAmong those expressing frustration at the lack of progress were Senators Chuck Hagel of Nebraska, John McCain of Arizona and Larry E.

It has introduced more than 100,000 public school students to Shakespeare.\nAlthough its productions have not always been accorded critical raves, the company has been nominated many times for Tony, Drama Desk and Drama League awards, and has won several Lucille Lortel and Obie awards.\nThe proposed new theater would ''be a friendly neighbor and will provide educational programs for the community,'' said Susan Goldfinger, senior vice president of the real-estate development department of the New York City Economic Development Corporation, which has committed $6.2 million from the Mayor's capital budget for the theater's construction. The city-owned land is to be conveyed to the theater through a long-term ground lease.\nSome community groups have angrily opposed the proposed arrival of a $485 million New Jersey Nets arena, the centerpiece of a $2.5 billion residential and commercial complex that the developer Bruce C. Ratner envisions for the area straddling the Atlantic Avenue rail yards not far from the academy. Mr. Gehry is also the prospective architect of the Nets project.\nSome local residents fear that an influx of arts groups would further drive up rents in the neighborhood, pushing out working-class minority residents.\nMr. Lichtenstein, the Brooklyn Academy's leader from 1967 to 1999, said the area had been gentrifying long before the advent of the cultural district. ''We're encouraging the construction of middle-income housing there,'' he said, adding that no existing structures would be displaced to make way for the new theater, except for those in parking lot.\n''I think the neighborhood would welcome it, because it's not about lining some developer's pocket,'' Patti Hagan said of the new theater. She is spokeswoman for the Prospect Heights Action Coalition, which has opposed Mr. Ratner's plan. Mr. Ratner is also the development partner of The New York Times Company in a new building for the newspaper's headquarters.\nMr. Horowitz, who lives in Boerum Hill, said the theater could be rented to cultural organizations and local groups 12 to 16 weeks a year, when company productions were not running. ''Our educational programs will reach out to the neighborhood,'' he said.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nThe theater company, which has a $3 million annual operating budget, has been looking for a permanent home since 1997.\n''The theater is tiny, and the budget is tiny,'' Mr. Gehry said, ''but we hope this can lead to an interesting space.'' He has designed theaters in Los Angeles and Annandale-on-Hudson, N.Y., and is creating another in Miami.\nAs currently envisioned the theater is to have an open, glassy lobby space that would be ''its own marquee, statement and front door,'' said Mr. Hardy, an architect on many previous theater projects, including the renovations of the New Victory, the New Amsterdam, the Joyce and Radio City Music Hall.New Theater For Brooklyn Arts District", "Hamas names Dr Abdel Aziz Rantisi, one of its most combative leaders, as its leader in Gaza following Israel's killing of founder, Sheik Ahmed Yassin; photos; Israeli security says 'there is no immunity for anyone' in fight against Palestinian terrorism; Rantisi vows to continue attacks; Pres Bush says he worries about all terrorist groups, whether Hamas or Al Qaeda; Rantisi's authority is not clear, since Syrian-based Khaled Mashaal remains head of political bureau, which Rantisi says he will 'obey'; Israeli aircraft hit Hezbollah operatives assembling missile launcher in southern Lebanon, killing two; soldiers kill armed Palestinian approaching Jewish settlement in Gaza; bulldozers demolish several homes in Khan Yunis camp that overlooks settlement; Rantisi is known for most vitriolic statements and opposition to any compromise; Yassin death produces deluge of international criticism and measure of Palestinian unity for now (M)While a major figure in the movement, Dr. Rantisi, a pediatrician in his mid-50's, lacks the towering stature of Sheik Yassin, who established Hamas in 1987. The sheik was killed in an Israeli helicopter strike as he left a Gaza City mosque after Monday morning prayers.\nIn Washington, President Bush did not repeat statements by a State Department spokesman that the administration was ''deeply troubled'' by the killing of Sheik Yassin. Instead, he told reporters that he was ''worried about terrorist groups targeting America.'' He added, ''Whether it be a Hamas threat, or an Al Qaeda threat, we take them very seriously in this administration.''\nThe Hamas leadership structure is fuzzy -- Sheik Yassin held the title of spiritual leader -- and the full extent of Dr. Rantisi's authority was not immediately clear. Khaled Mashaal, based in Syria, remains head of Hamas's political bureau, an important decision-making body, Hamas officials said. In an interview Tuesday night with the Arab satellite television network Al Jazeera, Dr. Rantisi said he would ''obey'' the political bureau.\nIn the past, there has been tension between Hamas leaders in the Palestinian territories and those in exile.\nThe killing of Sheik Yassin seemed, at least in the short term, likely to increase regional violence as Palestinian groups called for retaliatory attacks. Israeli aircraft carried out an attack Tuesday night just across the border in southern Lebanon against a group of Hezbollah militants assembling a missile launcher, the Israeli military said. Two militants were killed and one was wounded, The Associated Press reported from Beirut, citing a Lebanese security official.\nAlso, Israeli soldiers shot and killed an armed Palestinian who was crawling as he tried to approach the Jewish settlement at Morag, in the southern Gaza Strip.\n[Keeping up pressure in Gaza, about 10 Israeli tanks backed by helicopter gunships rolled about 100 yards into Khan Yunis refugee camp early Wednesday, and bulldozers razed several homes overlooking a Jewish settlement, Reuters reported, citing witnesses.\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

When Hamas and other Palestinian factions declared a unilateral truce with Israel last summer, Dr. Rantisi was a vocal critic of the decision. The truce never fully took hold, and collapsed within a couple of months.\nDr. Rantisi no longer practices medicine, and in recent years has taught medical courses at the Islamic University, where many students support Hamas. He spent years imprisoned by Israel, and was sent into exile in Lebanon in 1992 along with several hundred other Hamas members. The Palestinian Authority, which he frequently criticizes, also jailed him for about two years in the late 1990's. Last June he suffered multiple wounds when his car was hit by a missile on a Gaza City street, but quickly recovered.\nWhile Dr. Rantisi describes himself as a political figure, Israel says there is no distinction between the ''political'' and ''military'' wings of Hamas and that Dr. Rantisi is among those who have orchestrated the group's suicide bombing campaign even if they have not planned the details of attacks.\nThe death of Sheik Yassin brought a deluge of international criticism directed at Israel, and it also produced a measure of Palestinian political unity, at least temporarily.\nThe Fatah movement, which is more nationalist than religious, is headed by the Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat and Prime Minister Ahmed Qurei, and is the main rival of Hamas in Palestinian politics. But Fatah leaders have lavished praise on Sheik Yassin, and Mr. Qurei traveled from the West Bank to Gaza to attend the memorial service.\n''It is such an ugly crime committed by this government of murderers; it is the Israeli government that assassinated this symbol of resistance,'' Mr. Qurei said. ''We are witnessing today, here in his memorial, the unity of the Palestinian people.''\nIsrael, meanwhile, said it would press its current offensive in Gaza, which began a week ago in response to a double suicide bombing in the Israeli city of Ashdod by the Palestinians that killed 10 Israelis.\n''If we will continue, in a determined way, with our strikes against Hamas and other terror groups, with the means I outlined, including action against those leaders, we will bring more security to Israeli citizens,'' said Israel's defense minister, Shaul Mofaz.\nIsraeli security officials acknowledge that Sheik Yassin's killing has energized the Palestinian factions. But they say Hamas and the other groups were already going all-out to strike at Israel.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n''The Palestinians and Hamas feel they have lost a father,'' said Aharon Zeevi-Farkash, the head of military intelligence.

Seemed odd, but I figured the teacher knew best.\nIn my 20's, I noticed how the rhythm of the assertion of national unity at the conclusion of the Pledge of Allegiance -- ''one nation, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all'' -- was broken into by the insertion by Congress in 1954 of the phrase ''under God'' between ''one nation'' and ''indivisible.'' As a geezer today, I sometimes trip over the inserted piety in recitation.\nThis morning, the U.S. Supreme Court will hear the argument of an atheist who persuaded the Left Coast Court of Appeals to strike that religious phrase from the pledge recited in public school.

The problems and goals, laid out in a 64-page document, contain hundreds of small plans, from providing free nicotine patches to people trying to quit smoking to giving the new one-hour H.I.V. tests to inmates at Rikers Island.\nAt its core, the initiative sets out 10 major problem areas that researchers have found can be widely curbed -- from drug use to AIDS deaths to depression -- and sets a goal for improving each one. Notably missing among the 10 is obesity, because city officials say science has found no reliable way to address it.\n''It sets an agenda, and that's the fundamental concept here,'' said Dr. Frieden, the chief architect of the policy, which was drafted with help from a number of city agencies. ''It sets an agenda based on science, based on the evidence of what kills people, and what is amenable to intervention.''\nIf the goals occasionally sound out of reach, Dr. Frieden said, that is fine with him. ''We think these are attainable, but that is the reason for setting goals,'' he said. ''Hold us to them.''\nCity officials and public health experts said they knew of no other city -- or even anystate -- with such a broad, aggressive public health agenda.\n''I think this is a very bold vision, and I hope they can produce,'' said Dr. Allan Rosenfield, dean of the Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia University. ''I think they're very serious about it doing it. Each of the 10 priority areas is a serious problem with attainable goals. They're focusing mostly on prevention, which is smart because prevention can save thousands and thousands of lives a lot faster than curative medicine.''\nMany of the items in the policy will cost money, like printing pamphlets, distributing syringes and dispatching department workers to various projects. Officials said they were not yet able to say what the overall cost of the policy would be, and it is not clear how the city will pay for all the proposals. Dr. Frieden said some of the expense would be covered simply through eliminating duplication or contradictory work by different city agencies. He added that in the long run, many of the measures will save money not only for the health care system in general, but also for the city.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nBy setting 2008 as the target date for seeing improvements, the policy assumes either that Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg will be re-elected next year, or that his positions will outlast his administration.\nDr. Frieden conceded that some elements of the policy would be controversial, like a more aggressive sex-education program that he said his department was developing with the Department of Education, and for which no details are available yet. ''We expect some heat,'' he said.\nBeyond the city's own actions, the policy calls for changes in state and federal law -- and, in fact, many items put the administration of Mr. Bloomberg, a Republican, squarely at odds with the thinking of Republicans and conservatives in Albany and Washington. The policy advocates requiring health insurers to track and report their performance in areas like having their members screened for colon cancer and vaccinated for the flu, mandating nutrition labeling on restaurant meals, outlawing discount tobacco products and a presumption by government that children qualify for Medicaid until it is proved otherwise, to name just a few recommendations.\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

In a society already filled with the background noise of health messages -- lose weight, exercise, eat vegetables, take vitamins -- this may be the greatest challenge of all.\n''We're laying it all out there now, these 10 commandments of health, and yes, it's a lot, but we're going to highlight one piece at a time,'' said Dr. Benjamin K. Chu, president of the New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation, which helped draft the policy and will play a central role in attempting to carry it out. ''This month it's been colon cancer screening, in May it will be mammograms, then depression, then flu shots, and on. So we plan to build these programs year-round, repeating a list of clear messages, and over the years it will sink in.''\nDr. Frieden pointed to studies showing that the average doctor's visit covers only half the ground that it should, and that doctors simply do not have the time to ask all the recommended questions and touch on all the recommended subjects with each patient. As a result, he said, most people receive only the health care they demand, and the city intends to teach them to demand it.\nSurveys have shown that most people with high blood pressure, high cholesterol, high blood sugar and other danger signs do not have them under control -- that in fact, many do not even know how serious their problems are.\n''Doctors are going to start checking cholesterol when people walk in and say, 'Hey, doc, what's my cholesterol?''' Dr. Frieden said.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nTo that end, the city has created a health ''passport,'' much like the checkup and immunization cards many parents have for their children, and will make them available through community groups and doctors' offices. The city has printed 400,000 of the palm-size or wallet-size fold-out cards, in English and Spanish, and will encourage people to bring them to doctor visits to use as checklists.\nIn some instances, the city plans limited advertising to educate people about health concerns. But more often, officials say, they will rely on the help of hospitals, neighborhood groups, labor unions and businesses. They plan, for instance, to use ''envelope stuffers'' in utility bills and paychecks, reminding people to have various tests and vaccinations.\nThe city health department already sends a monthly newsletter to all the city's doctors and many of its nurses, and Dr. Frieden said it would soon have an Internet-based system for communicating with them.\nSome elements of the health policy are already in place. The menu of foods served in city schools is being revamped to eliminate junk food in vending machines and create more nutritious cafeteria meals. City clinics distributed their first round of free nicotine patches to 35,000 people last year.\nThe health department has started a program in Harlem of home visits to every new mother and hopes to expand it to other poor neighborhoods. And in cooperation with neighborhood groups, doctors and clinics, the department is using press conferences and fliers to urge people to have colon cancer screenings, starting with Bronx neighborhoods where screening rates are lowest.\nOn every page, the policy reflects Mr. Bloomberg's, Dr. Frieden's and Dr. Chu's shared mania for gathering and analyzing data, and for using the results to direct policy and gauge what programs are working.\nThe health department has conducted a detailed, 10,000-household survey that allows it to see, for example, how many Asian-Americans over 65 in Queens fail to get flu and pneumonia vaccines, or how many African-American mothers in Brooklyn have no prenatal health care.CITY SETS GOALS FOR THE HEALTH OF NEW YORKERS", "New details about tactics Microsoft Corp used to secure dominant role in software markets for nearly two decades are emerging in consumer class-action trial in Minnesota; among documents introduced is letter from June 1990 in wich Microsoft chairman Bill Gates told then Intel chief executive Andrew S Grove that any support given to software company Go Corp would be considered aggressive move against Microsoft; other evidence presented by plaintiffs' lawyers gives account of how Microsoft violated signed secrecy agreement with Go and showed that Microsoft possessed technical documents from Go that should not have had access to; Microsoft spokeswoman says many of newly disclosed documents are not relevant to trial, which focuses on Microsoft pricing actions (M)''These are very old documents, taken out of context for the sole purpose of obscuring the real issue of this case,'' said Stacy Drake, the Microsoft spokeswoman.\nBut lawyers for the plaintiffs contend that the documents show how Microsoft unfairly dominated the market. ''All of Microsoft's conduct was designed to acquire and hang on to their monopoly,'' said Eugene Crew, a lawyer at Townsend, Townsend & Crew, based in San Francisco. ''Consumers were harmed by being deprived of choice. The greatest harm out of the Go story was the suppression of innovation and new technology by Microsoft.''\nMicrosoft has already paid $1.6 billion in its efforts to settle consumer antitrust claims filed in 10 states.\nThe new lawsuit, which contends that Microsoft overcharged Minnesota customers from 1994 to 2001, seeks almost $500 million from the company. If the company, based in Redmond, Wash., loses, it could also be forced to pay triple that amount under Minnesota state law.\nThis week, the lawyers representing the Minnesota consumers are focusing on Microsoft's efforts to undercut Go, a start-up company that was developing an operating system for hand-held computers.\nThe first witness appearing at the trial yesterday was Jerry Kaplan, the co-founder of Go. Mr. Kaplan, who was a software developer at the Lotus Development Corporation before he started Go, has been a longtime opponent of Microsoft.\nYet he said he was surprised by what was revealed about Microsoft's activities in the documents. ''I was shocked,'' Mr. Kaplan said in a telephone interview.

Go was one of the most prominent efforts by Silicon Valley entrepreneurs and venture capitalists to create software for tablet-sized devices. In addition to an all-star cast of technologists, the start-up had backing from major industry players like I.B.M., Intel and AT&T.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nThe plaintiffs contend the new documents show that Microsoft violated nondisclosure agreements with Go, and then used that information to build PenWindows, a competitor to Go's PenPoint operating system. The documents included Microsoft's internal e-mail messages showing that it had detailed knowledge of Go's product plans.\nThe documents also suggest that Microsoft sought to pressure Intel to cancel its plans to invest in Go. On June 28, 1990, Mr. Gates wrote a letter to Mr. Grove trying to convince the Intel executive that he should back a version of Windows for portable computers, then code-named Windows-H, rather than Go's PenPoint software.\n''I guess I've made it very clear that we view an Intel investment in Go as an anti-Microsoft move, both because Go competes with our systems software and because we think it will weaken the 386 PC standard,'' Mr. Gates wrote.\nShortly after the letter was written, according to Mr. Kaplan, Intel reduced its planned investment in Go from $10 million to $2 million, and stipulated the investment be kept a secret.\nAn Intel spokesman declined to comment on the events.\nSilicon Valley executives said that Microsoft's aggressive behavior in the early 1990's led to a widespread belief among technology companies that Microsoft was using its operating system monopoly and unfair tactics to compete in markets where its technology was inferior.\nMicrosoft was well aware of this perception, and in 1991 tried to alter the way the company was viewed.\nIn a document titled ''Microsoft Criticism,'' the company's outside public relations consultants recommended training for its executives on ''personal demeanor and style.'' The advice read in part that the focus should be shifted from ''killing the competitor'' to ''providing a better solution to the customer's problems.''\n''It's a bit of artifact, but in its day it was a good memo,'' said Marianne Allison, an executive at Waggner Edstrom, Microsoft's longtime public relations firm.\nIn late 1993, Go was sold to AT&T where it was ultimately merged into the company's portable computer subsidiary. In 1994 the phone company shut down the effort in portable computing. Three months later Microsoft canceled its PenWindows project.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nIn 1996, Mr. Kaplan wrote a book, ''Start-Up: A Silicon Valley Adventure'' (Penguin USA), in which he blamed Microsoft, in part, for the demise of Go. Two years later, Marlin Eller, a former Microsoft programmer who was part of the PenWindows project, wrote in ''Barbarians Led by Bill Gates'' (Owl Books) that the intent of the PenWindows project had been primarily to undermine Go.Newly Released Documents Shed Light on the Tactics Used by Microsoft", "Lawyers for Connecticut Governor John G Rowland say he is complying with impeachment committee requests and express frustration and offense at implications by committee that Rowland has withheld documents from investigation (M)The written exchange -- over the whereabouts of correspondence between the governor and a state electrical contractor who gave him expensive cigars and Champagne -- reflected broadening tension. The governor, a Republican in his third term, remains defiant against accusations of wrongdoing and critical of the impeachment committee even as support for him -- and patience with the scandal -- continues to dwindle.\nWhile lawyers disputed procedural details in the investigation, Mr. Rowland, under investigation for accepting gifts from state workers and contractors, curtly addressed some of the questions raised in their exchange. Mr. Rowland said he had not previously disclosed the gifts of cigars and Champagne, from an electrical contractor, Kurt C.

Three lawyers involved in the investigation said last week that Peter Ellef, a former co-chief of staff for the governor, had advised Mr. Claywell to destroy any copies of the letter he might have and that Mr. Ellef then ripped up his own copy in Mr. Claywell's presence.\nBeyond the scrutiny from the committee and federal investigators, Mr. Rowland is facing pressure within his party. The Senate minority leader, Louis C. DeLuca, a Republican from Woodbury, said on Tuesday that he had told the governor during a visit a day earlier: ''It's not going to get any better. It's only going to get worse.'' Mr. DeLuca said that he had not asked the governor to resign but that he had told him he faced some ''tough decisions'' and to ''think about his family.''\nMr. DeLuca said that in the Senate, where the governor would be tried if the House voted to impeach him, Mr. Rowland has little support. Both the Democratic and Republican leaders of the House have said they think the House will vote to impeach Mr. Rowland if the special committee makes a firm recommendation.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nEven as pressure increases and many lawmakers call for his resignation -- 61 percent of state residents want him to step down, according to a recent poll by the University of Connecticut -- Mr. Rowland has insisted he will stay in office.\nBut Mr. DeLuca said he detected less conviction from the governor on Monday.\n''I get the sense that he's not as adamant as he once was and that he understands the gravity of the situation,'' he said. '' I don't know. It's just a feeling I get.''\nAt least one other development that surfaced this week revealed the tension surrounding the impeachment investigation.\nThe room in which the impeachment committee has been meeting, sometimes privately, in the Capitol, has recently been checked for wiretaps.

When he sat out Nov. 22, the schedule allowed him six days to rest, and he felt better for a few months. But a nine-day rest beginning March 1 was not as successful, and after Thursday's loss to Detroit, he finally gave in to the pain and sat.\n''He keeps getting some fluid in his knee and it inhibits his play,'' said Thorn, who is scouting high school players at the EA Sports Roundball Classic here. ''He's having problems pushing off his leg and as a knee retains fluid, you can't bend it like you normally can.

A parallel global code was adopted days later under American pressure by the United Nations's International Maritime Organization.\nThe law and the code set a July 1 deadline for all of the world's ships and ports to create counterterrorism systems -- computers, communications gear, surveillance cameras, security patrols -- to help secure America against an attack.\nThe cost of compliance at home and abroad will be many billions of dollars. Many American and foreign ports lack the funds to comply. But the cost of not complying could be steeper still. The law's demands create a stark confrontation between world trade and national security.\nIf a ship, or any one of the last 10 ports it visited, does not meet the new security standards, it can be turned away from American waters. If a port falls short, no ship leaving it can enter American harbors. That means ports, and their nations, can be barred from trading with the United States.\n''We're dead serious about this,'' said Rear Adm. Larry L. Hereth, director of port security for the Coast Guard. The law holds ''some very harsh economic consequences,'' he said, like banning ships and blacklisting ports, ''and we're prepared to do that.'' Enforcement will largely fall to the United States.\nThe high costs and the tight deadline have created a scramble in the world's major ports -- especially in poor ones like Puerto Cort\u00e9s, a sprawling, run-down harbor crucial to the livelihood of Honduras and its neighbors in Central America.\nSome say the price is too high, the task too huge and the time too short to comply.\n''The developing world is saying that the wealthiest, most powerful nation in the world is exporting the cost of protecting itself onto some of the world's poorest countries,'' said Stephen E. Flynn, a retired Coast Guard commander and a maritime security expert at the Council on Foreign Relations.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nAmerican officials contend that the costs are outweighed by the benefits: higher security against terrorism will also cut cargo thefts and the smuggling of drugs, guns and people. But if the United States cannot balance the competing demands of national security and global trade, ''we are playing with fire,'' Mr. Flynn said. ''If the U.S. locks down its ports for more than two weeks, the entire global trade system crashes.''\nPolicing the sea is daunting: the maritime system is bigger, more complex and far less controlled than international aviation. Ninety percent of world commerce moves on water, though, in 46,000 ships plying 3,000 ports. They carry millions of containers with billions of tons of goods. Roughly half of all international shipping is carried out under ''flags of convenience'' -- registries based in countries like Liberia, often intended to disguise a vessel's true ownership.\nHere in Honduras, one of the poorest countries in the Western Hemisphere, the economy depends on Puerto Cort\u00e9s, which is about 350 miles south of Canc\u00fan, Mexico. More than 100 ships a month leave the port for the United States, carrying everything from bluejeans to bananas, returning with American exports.\nIf the United States were to bar ships from the port for even a week, ''our national economy would collapse,'' said Mauro Membre\u00f1o, chief of Honduras's new National Commission on Port Security.\nThe port was a wide-open place, protected mainly by a rusting five-foot-high chain-link fence and a poorly paid police force, until the Honduran government began trying to secure it three months ago. Under an emergency decree, Honduras is spending $4 million to buy computer systems, patrol boats, police cars, cameras and other security gear for Puerto Cort\u00e9s. ''We have gotten moral support from the United States,'' said the national port director, Fernando \u00c1lvarez. ''Nothing concrete.''\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter.

View all New York Times newsletters.\nA United States official in Honduras says American pressure to secure Puerto Cort\u00e9s is intense, but notes that the United States is not paying for security, as it did when it gave Honduras more than $250 million during Central America's anti-communist campaigns in the 1980's.\n''We've got a gun to their heads,'' the official said. ''If this is the war on terrorism -- well, this is not how we fought the war on Communism.''\nDennis Chinchilla, Honduras's new national port security officer, said ''the people who work in Puerto Cort\u00e9s will have to completely change their way of life'' to adapt to the American law. Once the commercial harbor is secured, he said, the law demands that Honduras fix its main tourist port, on the island of Roat\u00e1n, where 250,000 travelers a year disembark from cruise ships. The security there today is a dollar-an-hour guard in a shack without a phone.\nIn the United States, many ports and ships missed a Dec. 31 deadline for submitting security plans. Port authorities note that President Bush's budget for port security in the coming year is $46 million, while the costs of compliance in the United States alone will reach $7 billion.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nThe Coast Guard, which must enforce the law, has three people assigned to international compliance, Mr. Flynn said. They confront a tradition of secrecy and deception that makes the maritime trade a tempting target for terrorists.\nRoughly half of the world's commercial ships fly flags of convenience registered in more than two dozen nations, including tiny tax havens and money-laundering centers like the Cayman Islands and Vanuatu. The tradition, which began with United Fruit Company vessels in Honduras in the 1920's, was devised to cut costs and, in many cases, evade taxes.\n''It's a bit like Swiss banks,'' Mr. Flynn said.\nFlags of convenience ''allow shippers to function with a high degree of anonymity,'' said Rupert Herbert Burns, a senior analyst at the Maritime Intelligence Group, a security firm in Washington.\nMaritime security officials say an American port could be struck in several ways. A cargo ship filled with fuel oil and ammonium nitrate fertilizer could become a waterborne fireball; a ship could carry a radiological ''dirty bomb'' into a harbor; a speedboat carrying explosives could blow up a tanker laden with oil or delivering liquefied natural gas.\nAdmiral Loy, citing court testimony and government reports, warned two years ago in the military journal Defense Horizons that Osama bin Laden, through associates using flags of convenience, controlled a fleet of cargo ships, including the vessel that delivered the explosives that blew up American Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998.\nHe noted that a month after the Sept. 11 attacks, Italian inspectors found an Egyptian on a ship bound for Canada. The Egyptian, hiding in a shipping container, had a false Canadian passport, a satellite phone, two computers, forged security passes for airports in three countries and papers identifying him as an aircraft mechanic.\nUncovering such a suspect is like finding a particular shark in a boundless sea. United States officials say the threat of an attack demands that nations like Honduras do their part. But Carl Bentzel, a Democratic counsel to the Senate Commerce Committee, said most of the world's ships and ports ''have so far to go and the costs are so high that most will not be in compliance'' by July 1.\nIf that happens, the United States has three choices, maritime security experts say. It can enforce the law, creating potential economic chaos abroad; bend the law, saying economic imperatives make full enforcement impossible; or apply the law selectively, creating a two-tier system in which rich ports in Europe and Asia trump poor Caribbean ones like Puerto Cort\u00e9s.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nAt Puerto Cort\u00e9s, Fermin Chong Wong, an American-educated computer expert working for the national port authority, is trying to track 400,000 containers and more than 2,000 ships a year.\n''I don't think there will be enough time to meet the United States requirements everywhere in the world,'' he said. ''I don't think U.S. ports can meet them. Here, we are going to try -- and we might. But the time's too short and the money's too scarce to do all this.''\n''We want to protect our borders,'' said Kim Petersen, who runs one of the world's biggest maritime consultancies, SeaSecure.

One reason is that they often use computer worms, spread from machine to machine, to send the fraudulent e-mail -- a technique that makes it almost impossible to trace the source.\nLike EarthLink's investigators, government authorities have managed to track down a few individuals operating less sophisticated ruses. The F.B.I. traced one crop of mass e-mail messages pretending to be from the ''AOL Billing Center'' to Helen Carr, 55, who ran the scheme from her home in Akron, Ohio. (Ms. Carr pleaded guilty and was sentenced in January to 46 months in prison.)\nBut federal investigators write off people like Ms. Carr as small-time operators. ''The kids in school and the old lady in her basement make great copy,'' said Bruce A. Townsend, deputy assistant director in the office of investigations at the Secret Service, which investigates cases of credit card fraud. ''But this has transformed into something done by organized criminal groups.''\nIn February, 282 cases of phishing e-mail messages were reported to the Anti-Phishing Working Group, a coalition of technology companies, financial institutions and law enforcement agencies. That was up from 176 attacks in January and 116 in December. Brightmail of San Francisco, which filters e-mail for spam, identified 2.3 billion phishing messages in February, 4 percent of the e-mail it processed, compared with only 1 percent of its messages as recently as September.\n''Identity theft is the single greatest type of consumer fraud,'' said Christopher A. Wray, an assistant attorney general in charge of the criminal division of the Justice Department, ''and phishing is the identity theft du jour.''\nAt this point, there are few sure ways for an Internet user to tell if an e-mail message is legitimate. So experts advise people to be extremely wary of providing any confidential information in response to e-mail.\n''The crooks are getting slicker, and the bogus Web sites and e-mails are dangerously legitimate looking,'' Mr. Wray said.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nNo one knows how much money has been stolen through phishing schemes. Banks say it still seems relatively small compared with other forms of fraud and theft, like using stolen credit or debit cards.\nOne reason it is not easy to figure out how much money has been lost is because many victims do not realize it when they have been fleeced. Even those who find an unauthorized charge on their credit card bills and bring this to the attention of the issuers do not necessarily know that the charge was caused by their response to a false e-mail message.\n''People think they are giving their credit card numbers to AOL because there is a problem in their account,'' said Eric A. Wenger, a lawyer for the Federal Trade Commission, which has brought civil actions against several phishers. ''If they find out four weeks later there are unauthorized charges on the credit card, it never occurs to them to connect the two events.''\nLisa Cook, a sales representative with Kraft Foods who lives in Brookline, N.H., was one of the lucky ones who discovered that she had been subject to phishing before she was significantly harmed. Ms. Cook responded one morning, before her first cup of coffee, to a message in her e-mail in-box seemingly from PayPal, the electronic payment service of eBay. It said she needed to update her account, so she dutifully provided her credit card and Social Security numbers, mother's maiden name and other identifying information.\nLuckily, she spotted a warning later the same day about Internet scams. Ms. Cook placed a panicked call to PayPal, which confirmed her fear that she had been phished.\nShe was able to cancel all her credit cards and change passwords before she lost any money. But the experience haunts her.\n''It will always be in the back of my mind,'' she said. ''I worry that some day down the road, someone will take out a mortgage using my information.''\nPhishing got its name a decade ago when America Online charged users by the hour. Teenagers sent e-mail and instant messages pretending to be AOL customer service agents in order to fish -- or phish -- for account identification and passwords they could use to stay online at someone else's expense. After AOL switched to a flat monthly rate, the same phishing methods were used to steal credit card information.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nThese days, the same factors are driving all sorts of spam in much greater amounts.\n''It doesn't cost any money to go out and copy someone else's Web page to make it look real,'' said John Curran, a supervisory agent for the F.B.I. ''And it doesn't cost any money to spam the e-mail out to one million people.''\nThe phisher's goal is to persuade a recipient that he has received a legitimate message, which must be replied to immediately.\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Please try again later. View all New York Times newsletters.\nAs for motivation, phishers sometimes appeal to greed by sending an e-mail message that promises the recipient a prize, asking for a credit card number only to bill for shipping costs. More often, they rely on fear.\n''The initial hook is something alarming,'' Mr. Curran said. ''They tell you they will shut down your account or you have been charged for child pornography. Once they get you in a state where you are agitated or excited, they can elicit an emotional response.''\nThe open technology used in both e-mail and Web browsing make it easy to create convincing fakes and difficult for recipients to verify who is really behind them. Even people with only modest technical skills can take graphic elements from a legitimate Web site and make a credible copy. (Many phishing attempts last year were riddled with typographical errors and awkward language, but now it appears that most phishers have brushed up on their English or hired proofreaders.)\nPhishers often create Internet addresses that closely resemble legitimate ones. Some have used domains that included ''yahoo-billing.com'' and ''eBay-secure.com.'' How is the typical user to know those are not real, but ''billing.yahoo.com'' is?\nIn response, Microsoft has modified Internet Explorer, the most popular Web browser, to make it harder to fool users and it has more changes planned for the next browser update planned for release this summer.\nA few Internet companies are going further. EBay and EarthLink have both developed toolbars that can be added to Internet Explorer to warn users if they are looking at known fraudulent sites.\nBut Howard Schmidt, a vice president for security at eBay, acknowledged that these approaches -- and eBay's frequent warnings to its customers and PayPal's -- have their limits.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n''Technology can solve 60 percent of the problem,'' he said. ''Education and awareness can solve 20 percent, and no matter how good the industry is, there will be people who fall victims so 20 percent will have to be handled by law enforcement.''\nBut even the small-time phishers who have been caught show how simple it is to use easily accessible high-technology tools to fool people. In February, Alec Scott Papierniak, 20, a college student in Mankato, Minn., pleaded guilty to wire fraud. He had sent people e-mail messages with a small program attached that purported to be a ''security update'' from PayPal. The program monitored the user's activity and reported their PayPal user names and passwords back to Mr. Papierniak.\nProsecutors say that at least 150 people installed the software, enabling Mr. Papierniak to steal $35,000.\nWhile most of those prosecuted so far for phishing have been in the United States, eBay, working with the Secret Service, has investigated a series of scams originating in Romania. More than 100 people have been arrested by Romanian authorities. One of them, Dan Marius Stefan, convicted of stealing nearly $500,000 through phishing, is now serving 30 months in a Romanian prison.\nMr. Stefan sent e-mail messages that appeared to come from eBay to people who were unsuccessful auction bidders, advising them of similar merchandise for sale at even better prices.

Do not provide information that is supposed to be secret, like a PIN for an A.T.M. card. Think twice before entering credit card numbers for offers that appear too good to be true, like merchandise with an unusually low price or a contest that requires you to pay a small handling fee to receive a prize.\nSUSPICIOUS LINKS -- If there is any reason to doubt the authenticity of an e-mail message, do not click on any link or button in the message. Instead, type the Internet address of the company into your browser, log in as you usually do, and examine your account information.\nPROTECTION FEATURES -- Look for the padlock icon on the bottom of the browser window that indicates that the site is using security features meant to protect confidential information. If a site is asking for personal information and is not using this security method, it is suspect. But the padlock, in itself, is no assurance a site is legitimate. Phishers are increasingly learning how to use their own secure sessions.\nREPORT PHISHING ATTEMPTS -- Do not hesitate to telephone a company to ask if an e-mail is legitimate. Let any organization being impersonated know of the scam and alert the Anti-Phishing Working Group at reportphishing@antiphishing.org, the Federal Trade Commission (UCE@FTC.GOV) and the F.B.I.'s Internet Crime Complaint Center (www.ic3.gov).\nIf you have any reason to suspect that you have inadvertently provided information to a phisher, contact your bank and credit card companies immediately. Also, change any online passwords that you may have revealed to the phishers. If you provided information that could be used for identity theft -- like a Social Security number -- contact the three major credit bureaus -- Equifax (800-525-6285), Experian (888-397-3742) and Trans Union (800-680-7289) -- to put a fraud warning on your credit file.TECHNOLOGY; Online Swindlers, Called 'Phishers,' Lure the Unwary", "Summary of some major stories on inside pages11 Iraq Police Officers Die\nIn the latest attacks against Iraqi police officers, gunmen killed nine officers riding in a minibus in southern Iraq and two officers parking a car in northern Iraq.

''It's like a vitamin for the food.'' After a few minutes, the soffritto was steaming, and he added a cup of white wine, which came to a simmer quickly.\nWhen the wine had reduced by about half, he added 10 full cups of red onions sliced paper-thin, a tear-jerking mass that nearly overflowed the pan. He stirred them around vigorously with his spoon, watching the pot. From his seasoning palette, he added several pinches of salt and stirred again.\n''I put in the salt now because it helps the onions release their water,'' Mr. Casella said. He took pinches of crushed red pepper flakes from the palette, and added them, too.\nAs the onions cooked, they hissed, gradually softening and shrinking in volume. After a few minutes of cooking, Mr. Casella said, ''See, it starts to stick, you caramelize the sugar on the onions.'' The onions closer to the bottom of the pan had begun to lose their vibrant purple.\nApropos of nothing: ''Here, it's the opposite of Italy. In the United States, food in big cities is good. Outside of the cities, you're lucky to find a McDonald's. In Italy, you find in the country small places, very good places, where the wife or sister cooks in the kitchen, and the husband is up front.''\nTo the suggestion that the situation is similar in France, Mr. Casella agreed but was quick to make a distinction between restaurant kitchens in France and Italy.\n''Kitchens in France are big, professional,'' he said. ''In Italy, most of the chefs are women, and they cook in a different way. In France, the relationship to food is institutional, serious, like Russian soldier. Italian kitchen is maybe less professional, maybe not so pretty, but much more fun. And the flavors are good because Italians, they cook with more touch, more love.''\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nMr. Casella turned back to the soup. ''This is too much,'' he said, throwing up his hands and shaking his head. He took the saucepan from the burner. Some of the onions had stuck to the bottom of the pan in the center, where the heat was most intense. Though they smelled enticing, they had browned further than he wished.\nSo he found a new pan, transferred the contents to it and added what looked to be a quart of vegetable broth. ''If you want to make it more strong,'' he said, ''You use the chicken broth.''\nFrom a short, stout bottle, Mr. Casella poured a dash of balsamic vinegar into the soup and said, ''This we leave cook.'' He clapped his hands together. ''Eh, bravo. We see what happens.''\nHe let the soup simmer. As it cooked, it turned from a yellow broth with purple streaks of red onion, to a paler, grayer soup, the onions nearly translucent.\nAfter about 15 minutes, Mr. Casella dipped a spoon into it, and turned in profile to take a sip, casting a nose worthy of a Pontormo painting into sharp relief. ''If there were more onions, it would be better, but it's O.K.,'' he said. He added more broth, a cup or so, and threw in pinches of salt and pepper and a small amount of a Tuscan spice blend called spezie forti from his plate of seasonings. (Home cooks can blend their own from cloves, mace and cinnamon, or use garam masala.)\nHe poured a few more drops of balsamic vinegar into the pot. ''I am against fake balsamic vinegar,'' he said.\nHe let the soup cook 10 minutes more, then added a cup and a half of fresh peas from a small glass bowl. ''The peas are for color even more than for flavor,'' he said.\nThe assistant in chef's whites appeared again, with four poached eggs steaming in a small bowl, and a plate with slices of Tuscan bread that had been grilled, brushed with oil, dusted with Parmigiano-Reggiano and broiled.\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

''And the bit of acidity goes well with sweet onions and eggs.''\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nHe set a piece of the grilled bread in the bottom of each of four sturdy, hand-painted ceramic bowls. He gingerly spooned a poached egg on top of each toast, then ladled the soup, which appeared to be more solid than liquid, over the eggs.\nHe finished the dish by sprinkling grated Parmigiano-Reggiano over the top and setting the bowls beneath the broiler for a few minutes until the cheese browned slightly.\nIn the finished dish, the balance of onions to broth was weighted so steeply toward the onions that we asked if it might qualify as a vegetable side dish.\n''Yes,'' Mr. Casella replied. ''In Tuscany, the soups are more dense, not so much broth.'' He dunked a spoon into his bowl. ''In many places, the soup was dinner, the bread was in the soup, and the egg was the protein.

Aventis executives have hinted for weeks that they might embrace some mysterious suitor other than Sanofi, but the company might have to make a choice soon.\nIn January, Sanofi announced that it was making a $59 billion hostile offer for Aventis in part because a deal that had kept 44 percent of its shares in the hands of two large holders is scheduled to expire at the end of the year. Aventis's managers rebuffed the bid, but Sanofi may yet persuade the company's shareholders to tender their shares. Then rumors circulated that Dr. Vasella might enter the bidding.\nTop French officials have made clear from the start that they are hoping Sanofi succeeds in creating a French-based drug giant. The French prime minister, Jean-Pierre Raffarin, said last week that France's need for vaccines to fight bioterrorism was a crucial reason why the government might oppose a non-French bidder for Aventis. And CDC Finance, a corporate financing arm of the government-owned bank CDC-Ixis, agreed recently to join a syndicate of banks providing financing for Sanofi's bid.\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

But he made no apologies for investigating a possible Aventis deal. ''When you have company like Aventis on the market,'' he said, ''you ought to do your homework as a manager.''\nOnce his homework was through, Dr. Vasella said the combination started to look more and more promising. The combined companies would have the best portfolio of cancer drugs in the industry and top franchises in diabetes and cardiovascular products.\nFinally, Dr. Vasella said that he thought consolidation in the pharmaceutical industry was bound to continue. Small and large drug companies can continue to thrive, he said. But those stuck in the middle will struggle, he said, in part because they will have trouble attracting licensing partners. That is why Novartis continues to look for potential deals, he said. The company bought a considerable stake in Roche Holding. Roche executives have said they have no interest in a combination with Novartis.\nStill, a deal with Aventis is not feasible in the face of French government opposition, Dr. Vasella said.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nMany analysts say that a combination with Novartis makes more sense for Aventis' shareholders than one with Sanofi. ''If I were an Aventis shareholder, I'd much rather have Novartis come in because there's much greater earnings potential,'' said Catherine Arnold, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein.\nNovartis already has considerable operations in the United States so it can cut jobs from Aventis after a combination, she said. Sanofi needs those operations so it will not be able to save as much money.\nNovartis also has a lot more money to spend on Aventis than Sanofi, Ms. Arnold said. Still, she is betting Sanofi will win because of the French government's support. ''Novartis is going to win a bidding war,'' she said, ''but they're not going to come in just to be trifled with by the French government.''\nHemant K. Shah, an analyst with HKS Securities, said that companies could not fight governments.

''Johnny Guitar,'' Nicholas Ray's convention-bending fever dream of a movie from 1954, has been translated into a downright cozy pocket musical at the Century Center for the Performing Arts.\nThe modest, blandly tuneful show called ''Johnny Guitar'' that opened last night is unlikely to inspire anything like the brickbats or valentines that have been tossed over the years at the film. A baroquely stylized, Freudian vision of an American frontier land where two women stand tall and men quake in their shadows, Ray's movie was greeted with mostly derisive reviews when it opened.\nIts star, a virile Joan Crawford (pitted against a raging, repressed puritan played by Mercedes McCambridge), would later say there was ''no excuse for a picture being this bad or for me making it.'' But the film quickly became a favorite of the French auteurists at the Cahiers du Cin\u00e9ma, as well as of gay men of all sexes. Today liking ''Johnny Guitar'' signifies membership in a club of rarefied cinematic tastes that also embraces the grand soap operas of Douglas Sirk.\nAlthough the movie has been read as an allegory of the Communist witch hunts of the 1950's, it's the camp in the campfire that is more or less celebrated in ''Johnny Guitar: The Musical,'' which features songs by Martin Silvestri and Joel Higgins and a book by Nicholas van Hoogstraten. But don't expect a mad, insiderly extravaganza in the style of drag artists like Charles Busch. (The women, for the record, are played by women here.) As directed by Mr. Higgins, this is a wholesome, corny wink of a production that should neither offend nor overstimulate anyone.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nThe script sticks closely to the film's, which was based on Roy Chanslor's novel, though it eliminates most of the bloodshed.

Bailey, an analyst at Deutsche Bank, said in a report. Another analyst, John Gerdes of Southwest Securities, downgraded Anadarko.\nEven as the Gulf of Mexico's role in domestic oil supplies has grown more prominent -- it accounted for 30 percent of domestic production last year, from 16 percent in 1995, and is expected to grow to 40 percent by 2010 -- the area is a small part of the global market. It accounted for just 2 percent of total world production in 2003, and while production in the gulf is growing and is expected to peak at 2.4 million barrels a day around 2009 or 2010, it is expected to decline to about 2 million a day by 2020, according to the Energy Information Administration.\nGas production, which was once thought to have peaked in the early 1990's, is also expected to increase from current levels. Projections of a decline in the gulf explain in part the mammoth investments oil companies are making in other countries with large offshore reserves. In Kazakhstan, for example, a group including ENI of Italy, Exxon Mobil and Royal Dutch/Shell confirmed recently that it was proceeding with a $29 billion project to develop that nation's Kashagan field.\nStill, largely because the Gulf of Mexico is so close to major refineries and pipelines in Texas and Louisiana, Robert W. Esser, a senior consultant and director at Cambridge Energy Research Associates, said he considered the region ''the world's premier exploration province.''\nThat may explain why exploration companies submitted 827 bids worth a total of $368.8 million for 557 tracts at the mineral service's auction in New Orleans last week. The most sought-after tracts were in shallow waters that could contain gas deposits deep under the continental shelf and in very deep waters where technology is allowing drillers to search for gas with greater efficiency.\nThe main risk of drilling in deep-shelf waters, where wells descend 15,000 feet or more beneath the sea floor, is the possibility that companies might find no gas at all after investing millions of dollars. Nexen, a Canadian energy company, jolted the industry in February when it reported that a well it had drilled with a unit of Royal Dutch/Shell had come up dry. The unproductive well, at nearly 26,000 feet the deepest ever drilled on the gulf shelf, cost the companies about $35 million.\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

''Is the gas there, and is it there in quantities that justify large investments? Yes, but the technology needs to get better to reduce the costs and risks.''\nAnadarko's new platform illustrates the lengths -- literally and figuratively -- that energy companies will have to go to if they want to tap the region's reserves. This platform, in 4,300 feet of water, is connected to the sea floor by flexible metal tendons, and it sways so much that visitors arriving by helicopter are given motion-sickness tablets before they land. Still, the platform can produce 50,000 barrels of oil a day.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nFederal officials also say that incentives are needed to encourage greater investment in the gulf. The Minerals Management Service, a part of the Interior Department, took one such step in January, when it said it would suspend royalty collections on successful wells drilled in some parts of the gulf. It cited the domestic demand for natural gas, which is forecast to grow 42 percent over the next two decades.\n''The gap between supply and demand for natural gas is a national problem that is not going away,'' Interior Secretary Gale A. Norton said in an interview. ''Our incentives should help offset the tremendously high costs of exploration and production in frontier areas of the gulf.''\nWhile energy executives and analysts said that fewer royalty payments would generate more revenue from some projects, it remains to be seen whether the new policy will result in more exploration. At best, over the life of a project, the minerals agency's program would cut royalties on some producing wells by more than 10 percent, but such a reduction would matter little to companies weighing the risk of spending $20 million to $30 million to drill a well.\n''The royalty relief is much ado about nothing,'' Mr. Esser of Cambridge Energy said.\nThe biggest test of whether the gulf can fulfill expectations of meeting a growing portion of the nation's demand for oil and gas is expected over the next three years, when bidding is set to begin on expiring leases for many deepwater tracts. Still, many companies are waiting to see how relatively new projects like Anadarko's platform proceed before they consider bidding.\nIn an unusual arrangement, Anadarko operates the platform while it is owned by two other Houston energy companies with experience in the gulf -- GulfTerra and Cal Dive International. Executives at Anadarko said this arrangement freed them to focus on producing from the field directly below Marco Polo and in nearby areas that can be served by the platform, which was designed to process as much as 120,000 barrels of oil and 300 million cubic feet of natural gas a day eventually.\n''This project needs to pay not only for itself but for other explorations as well,'' said Richard C. Pratt, Anadarko's manager of Gulf of Mexico operations, as he gained his footing shortly after arriving on Marco Polo, swallowing Dramamine tablets. Mr. Pratt, who used to manage Anadarko's operations in Algeria, said the platform's first barrels of oil should be pumped by the middle of this year -- several months behind schedule.\n''The attractions of the gulf are its lack of political risk compared with other parts of the world and its proximity to the U.S. market,'' Mr. Pratt said. ''But the fundamental risks here, like the weather or the chance your investment will come up dry, are the same as anywhere else.''Trying to Squeeze More Oil and Gas From the Gulf of Mexico", "Mark Bittman The Minimalist column offers recipe for chicken soup with smoked jalapeno peppers (M)CHICKEN SOUP is a product of every cuisine in the world with access to chickens, though it took a lot of eating on my part to realize that the Jewish-style brew I grew up with seems among the world's least interesting.\nOn the other end of the spectrum is the kind of stuff you get in Mexico, garnished with diced raw onion, avocado, tomato and a squeeze of lime.\nIt is even better when served with chipotle paste, which may not have the staying power of a matzo ball but has the flavor power of smoked jalape\u00f1os -- exactly what chipotles are.

Without a plan by then, it would be ''unable to meet all of its debt obligations,'' the company said. The waiver on existing loan commitments and a new credit facility from Walt Disney provided Euro Disney some respite after its loss widened last year on a slump in tourism.

The company has since acknowledged that additional employees traded improperly, and, as of the end of last year, fired a total of 15 employees, the S.E.C. said.\nPutnam argued in its filing that the fine sought by the S.E.C. was extreme, given the relatively small profit made by the employees. Putnam has previously said it would compensate shareholders for any improper trading.\nPutnam called the S.E.C.'s arguments ''a transparent attempt to find a way to reach a headline-making number.''\nA spokesman for the commission declined to comment.\nThe S.E.C. said in its filing that the amount to be paid by Putnam should be weighed against the amount of assets investors have pulled from the fund company since the improper trading became public. As of Dec. 31, investors had withdrawn more than $54 billion, the S.E.C. said.\nPutnam concealed the improper trading from its fund trustees and its investors ''to protect the jobs and reputation of several high-level executives and to avoid the massive loss of clients and their management fees that would -- and eventually did -- follow,'' the S.E.C. said. ''By concealing its fraud, Putnam unjustly received massive amounts of management fees during nearly four years in which it continued to operate its business as usual.''\nInvestors might have withdrawn that money earlier had they been aware of the improper trading, the commission said. Therefore, it would be reasonable for the company to forfeit management fees on the $54 billion, the S.E.C. said.\nAlternatively, the S.E.C. said, the judge could simply ask Putnam to repay fees on the sums frequently traded by Putnam employees. The commission is also seeking penalties that could amount to more than $100 million, according to the legal filing.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nPutnam's fund trustees yesterday made public a report that says the company ''made extensive efforts to identify and deter excessive short-term trading,'' according to a statement released by the trustees.\nBuried in the report, though, is an acknowledgment that Putnam's general counsel, William H.

Such trading violated Putnam's code of ethics, the report said.\nIan C. Ferguson, Putnam's former chief investment officer, was also aware of the trading, and told Lawrence Lasser, the company's chief executive at the time, about it, the report said.\nMr. Ferguson left in June 2003, a Putnam spokeswoman said, and Mr. Lasser resigned last November. Mr. Wolverton remains at the company, although Putnam is recruiting a new general counsel, she said.

Galvin, the secretary of the commonwealth.\nPutnam allowed one of its retirement plan customers, Boilermakers Local Lodge No.5, to make hundreds of trades in and out of its funds, according to a complaint filed by Mr. Galvin's office against the company last October. Such trading was forbidden, according to Putnam's stated policies.\nMassachusetts regulators are looking at whether there was a pattern among other 401(k) plans managed by Putnam, Mr. Galvin said.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nA spokesman for Mr. Spitzer declined to comment on negotiations with Putnam.\nAnother investment firm, Janus Capital, is close to settling with regulators, with an announcement possible by the end of the month, people briefed on the talks said.\nThe amount Janus will pay as part of the settlement is likely to be smaller than any settlement reached to date in the fund trading cases, these people said. That is because the amount of trading at Janus was relatively modest compared with that of other fund companies.\nJanus said in December that it would pay shareholders $31.5 million in compensation for rapid trading in and out of Janus funds.\nA Janus spokeswoman declined to comment on the status of negotiations.

''This is the world's greatest humanitarian crisis, and I don't know why the world isn't doing more about it.''\nCountless thousands of black Sudanese have been murdered, and 600,000 victims of this ethnic cleansing have fled to other parts of Sudan and are suffering from malnutrition and disease. The 110,000 who have fled into Chad are better off because of the magnificent response of the Chadian peasants.

To his credit, President Bush has already led the drive for peace in Sudan, doing far more to achieve a peace than all his predecessors put together. Now he should show the same resolve in confronting this latest menace.\nIn the 21st century, no government should be allowed to carry out ethnic cleansing, driving 700,000 people from their homes.

Lomax's collection contains more than 5,000 hours of sound recordings, 400,000 feet of motion-picture film, 2,450 videotapes, 2,000 books and journals, hundreds of photographs and negatives, and several databases for portions of the archive, as well as more than 120 linear feet of manuscript materials, including correspondence, field notes, research files, program scripts, indexes and book and article manuscripts.

Lomax, the first to record Woody Guthrie, Muddy Waters and Leadbelly, was in charge of the library's Archive of American Folk Song until 1942, when he left to pursue his musical anthropology in the United States and abroad. His collection had been in several large rooms at Hunter College, overseen by the Association for Cultural Equity, which he founded in 1985 to research, preserve and disseminate world folk performances.

Japan's so-called tertiary activity index, which tracks retail and service spending, grew 2.6 percent in January from December, the largest increase since March 2000, helped by strong demand for financial services and solid retail sales.

In London, you have what the British call a gastropub. In Manhattan, you have a phenomenon.\nThe phenomenon du jour, the Spotted Pig, is one of the most crowded little restaurants in New York. People waiting for seats fill the bar area and spill out into the street.\nSome are no doubt attracted by the celebrity component: the mere mention of Mario Batali and Joe Bastianich, the team from Babbo, etc., who are investors in the Spotted Pig, seems enough to cause a culinary riot. Others may come for the rock royalty connection. (Ken Friedman, the principal owner, is a veteran of the music industry, who counts Bono among his investors.) Still others may have heard about the restaurant's young English chef, April Bloomfield, who has cooked at both River Cafe, the groundbreaking Italian restaurant in London, and Chez Panisse in Berkeley, Calif.\nAll of these would pique curiosity about any restaurant. But the Spotted Pig succeeds because it does not settle for star power. Instead, it relies on a winning confluence of casual yet imaginative food served in an easygoing, almost rustic atmosphere, where worn-velvet banquettes are strewn with pillows and pig paraphernalia adorn the walls. Music is loud but not too loud, a good match for the exuberance of the patrons.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nOn my first visit, I liked the look and feel of the place, which was previously Le Zoo.

''There's no one lead,'' he said during the re-editing process, when three editors were reworking on sections of the film. ''We've got to keep six characters alive, which is proving really difficult. We may have attempted to do too much.'' Last week Mr. Johnson and the director, Mr. Hancock, said they were happy with the final version. ''I feel really good about it,'' Mr. Hancock said. ''The scenes are shorter. If any character suffered from this, it's secondary'' to the story.\nFilms that are pulled from release schedules for further editing are often labeled troubled in Hollywood, and ''The Alamo'' is no exception. Its fate has been fodder for Texas newspapers and Internet movie sites. And though script changes, delays and inflated budgets are not uncommon, the attention on the troubles of ''The Alamo'' could hardly come at a worse time for Disney. While last year the movie studio was the company's one bright spot, this year it has already had one pricey disappointment in ''Hidalgo,'' an estimated $140 million production (Disney officials would not confirm the figure) that so far has taken in only $48.5 million at the box office.\nAn expensive animated film opening on April 2, ''Home on the Range,'' which is said to have also cost close to $100 million, has poor advance word according to market research.\nAll of this comes just on the heels of the shareholder revolt against Michael D. Eisner, the Walt Disney Company's chief executive, which led this month to his removal as chairman and the appointment of George J. Mitchell to the position.\nDick Cook, chairman of Disney Studios, said he was confident that the delayed film would be worth the wait. ''I'm thrilled'' with the new version, Mr. Cook said in an interview on Monday. ''We all felt we've got something really great, really special. We made an epic.''\nIn May 2002 Disney proudly announced its intention to remake the classic tale of ''The Alamo,'' with Mr. Eisner saying the film would ''capture the post-Sept. 11 surge in patriotism.'' Disney said it would take care to give context to the Mexican side of the battle, leading to observations in the press that the film would be a politically correct version of the tale.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nThe latest of many screen versions, ''The Alamo'' was to be based on the 1836 story of about 200 defenders -- mostly Texians (Anglo immigrants to Texas, then a part of Mexico) and a few Tejanos (people of Mexican descent living in Texas) -- who held the fort for 13 days before it fell to Mexican troops led by Gen. Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna.\nThe Alamo heroes included Col. William Travis (Patrick Wilson), Bowie (Mr. Patric) and Crockett (Mr. Thornton), whose last stand passed into history and became a rallying cry for General Houston to win the war for Texas independence.\nMr. Howard had spent a year developing the script with the writer John Sayles (''Lone Star,'' 1996). The Oscar-winning writer Steven Gaghan (''Traffic,'' 2000) had been hired to polish the story, and vast sets had begun to rise on a plain near Austin when in July 2002 Disney said Mr. Howard would not be the director.\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Mr. Grazer said Mr. Eisner mainly pulled the plug over the R rating, which was the only way Mr. Howard saw to direct the film.\n''We finally found the right filter through which the story was worth retelling,'' Mr. Grazer said. ''The only way it really made sense was within the psyche of the three guys'' inside the Alamo fort.\nMr. Grazer said that he and Mr. Howard felt they had had Disney's commitment to make an R-rated movie, which the studio ultimately rejected, and were upset because they had used their influence to get Mr. Crowe, much in demand at the time, to star. Ethan Hawke had also signed on for a supporting role, and Sean Penn was close to taking the Bowie role, Mr. Grazer said.\nDisney instead hired Mr. Hancock, whose first film, ''The Rookie,'' had become a modest hit. Mr. Hancock, a Texas native, said he had spent five weeks deciding to take the job, agreeing to a lower budget and a PG-13 rating.\n''I always looked at it as a character drama on a historic stage,'' said Mr. Hancock, 46, about undertaking the shoot. ''I was frightened. I'd never done anything like this before. Some days we had 12 cameras going, at once. Sometimes it was like directing the 'Monday Night Football' game from the booth. It's big.''\nShooting, scheduled for November 2002, got under way in January 2003, with a budget that had soared to $95 million. The studio erected what the producers say was the largest set built in North America, a 50-acre swath recreating the Alamo fort and the 19th-century town of San Antonio in Dripping Springs, 75 miles outside of modern-day Austin. ''You could shoot 360 degrees around safely without seeing anything but the entire town of San Antonio as it existed in 1836,'' Mr. Johnson said.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nMr. Hancock ended up with one million feet of film, and just a few months to trim it into shape, in time to be the centerpiece of Disney's Oscar season, Christmas films. Ultimately the director was not happy with the cut he had completed by October. The movie was tested at a length of 3 hours, and again at a length of 2 hours 25 minutes. ''Neither one was the right movie,'' Mr. Johnson said.\nThe essential problem was that the movie broke into three sections, with the fall of the Alamo happening at the end of the second section, and the third act involving Houston taking revenge for the fall of the fort. The director was grappling with getting to the siege and battle more quickly.\nOn Oct. 29, with some billboard advertising already in place and the trailer mailed to the news media, Mr. Cook, chairman of Disney Studios, agreed to pull ''The Alamo'' from its schedule, just eight weeks ahead of its planned release date.\n''Ultimately the end product is more important than the need to meet arbitrary deadlines for awards, etc.,'' Mr. Cook said at the time.\nThe epic was trimmed to two hours, then tested. Two weeks ago another 15 minutes was reinserted into the film. The filmmakers said that Mr. Quaid's role had shrunk considerably and that other roles had been cut entirely.\nFor Mr. Hancock, the director, it has been an agonizing process. Last week he was near tears, Mr. Johnson said, when he called an actor to tell him his role had to be eliminated.\nDespite the delay Disney has put significant marketing muscle behind the film, spending an estimated extra $35 million on advertising, including during the Super Bowl. The studio has planned a star-studded, blowout premiere in San Antonio on Saturday night, and a three-day media junket.\nCorrection: March 27, 2004, Saturday An article in The Arts on Wednesday about the Walt Disney Company's problems in filming ''The Alamo'' misstated the distance between Austin, Tex., and Dripping Springs, where the studio recreated the Alamo and 19th-century San Antonio. It is 22 miles, not 75.A Battle Disney May Never Forget; For 'The Alamo,' a Long and Bumpy Road, From Conception to Release", "Grievances simmering among Syria's Kurds for decades erupt with antigovernment protests that are extremely rare in country with grim memories of suppression; restive Kurds in north have defaced images of Hafez al-Assad and protests led troops to fire on demonstrators, further aggravating tensions; photos; map; Kurdish Syrians, two million of country's 17 million people, say that watching new rights next door in Iraq finally pushed them to demand greater recognition (M)Clashes on March 11 between fans from rival soccer teams set off the sudden squall, which officially left 25 people dead and dozens wounded. But the raw emotions shocked Syrians and left officials painting a sinister picture of foreign plots to partition the country.\nTo a man, local officials all suggest that the Kurds were motivated by infiltrators from Iraq. ''They came from outside the country, from the east, and they have been paid in U.S. dollars supplied by Bremer and his gang,'' said Ahmed al-Salah, an employee of a burned-down government feed warehouse in Qamishliye, some 400 miles northeast of Damascus. He was referring to L. Paul Bremer III, the American administrator of Iraq.\nFor their part, Kurdish residents claim the government responded to what they call peaceful protests with violence as an excuse to say Syria remains too unstable to introduce the kind of democratic reforms that are helping their brethren in Iraq.\n''We want democracy like the others,'' said Hoshiar Abdelrahman, another young shopkeeper in Malikiya, 60 miles east of Qamishliye.\nThe question of minorities remains a highly sensitive, largely unspoken topic in Syria, particularly because one small group, the Alawites, dominates the government. ''Unity'' has been their rallying cry. Already edgy about the possibility Iraq will split on sectarian lines, Syrian officials see the Kurdish riots as another step in an attempt to partition all Arab states.\nAfter the first few demonstrators were killed, Kurdish areas throughout Syria bubbled over with years of repressed grievances, local residents say. In Malikiya, a town of one and two-story buildings, the tide of angry voices at the Saturday market eventually led to a march on city hall. As the crowd approached, troops opened fire, killing a 17-year-old and a 20-year-old, residents said.\nThe government version is that the Kurds starting setting fire to buildings first and the government fired on them to protect its property. ''If we were attacked by an Israel missile, we would respond with all means possible,'' said Salim Kabul, governor of Hassakeh Province, where Kurds are concentrated. ''So what do you expect when we are attacked from inside?''\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nHe put the toll in his province at 20 dead, including 14 Kurds and 6 Arabs, among them two policemen.

Instead, they complain, for the past four decades the government has been slowly moving more Arabs into the area, trying to form a belt 10 miles wide and 165 miles long to sever the Kurds from ethnic kin in Iraq and Turkey.\nVillage and even mountain names have been Arabized and the Kurdish language banned, although most families teach it at home. Worse, tens of thousands of Kurds are denied citizenship. (Kurdish groups say more than 200,000; the government says 100,000.) The government says Kurds denied citizenship are the offspring of illegal immigrants who came over the border from Turkey to find jobs and stayed.\n''My grandfather was born here, yet my father is considered a foreigner, I am a foreigner and my 3-year-old son has no nationality,'' said Mr. Abdelrahman, the shopkeeper. Both he and his wife's identification cards read ''single''; their marriage is not recognized.\nHe pulls out a tattered orange identification card that reads, ''Foreign Records Department, Hassakeh Governorate,'' and notes that the bearer cannot travel outside Syria.\nSuddenly every young man in a crowd that has gathered starts waving similar cards and shouting against the government. It was a brazen, unusual display of discontent, considering that the Ministry of Information had organized the recent tour for a few journalists, who were escorted by security officers.\nSyrian officials deny that the Kurds face any discrimination or have any real basis for their complaints. They note that the young President Assad visited the area in 2002 and pledged greater development, which will come.\nAfter the riots, the Kurdish Democratic Party in Iraq issued a statement suggesting that Damascus do something to end the problems in ''Syrian Kurdistan'' peacefully. Shock waves rippled through the government here.\nHoshar Zubairy, Iraq's Kurdish foreign minister, made his first official visit to Syria, partly to try to smooth ruffled feathers. At a news conference on Monday, where Mr. Zubairy was peppered with questions that fell just short of calling him an American stooge, he said Iraq had enough trouble with instability to want to create any here.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nOf course, not even a riot in the Middle East seems complete without invoking some historical precedent, in this case, Saladin. This Kurdish warrior, who is buried in Damascus, evicted the Crusaders from Jerusalem in 1187.\nSyrian officials asked aloud this week how a country that enshrined Saladin could mistreat his descendants. ''We want a political dialogue because our nation is for all,'' Ahmed Haj Ali, a consultant to the minister of information, said on Al Arabiya satellite television.\nBut Abdul Baqi Youssef, a Kurdish opposition figure in Qamishliye, said that by drawing all the warriors and intellectuals out of the Kurdish area to battle the Crusaders, Saladin left it buffeted by overlords to this day. ''The Arabs should consider him a saint, but he brought devastation to the Kurds,'' Mr. Youssef said.Gains by Kin in Iraq Inflame Kurds' Anger at Syria", "Letter from Europe on debate in Germany about malaise afflicting politics and economy; photos (M)''Germany is still the No. 1 exporting country in the world; this hasn't changed,'' Johannes Rau, the country's departing president said a few weeks ago in an interview that caused a great deal of comment. ''We don't have any reason to complain.''\nIn a country where unemployment has remained at 10 percent for several years and up to 25 percent in some cities and towns (mostly in the former East) there certainly are, Mr. Rau acknowledged, people whose lives are very tough. ''But,'' he said, ''many people are whining despite having a very high standard of living and a secure source of income, and I don't think that's right.''\nIndeed, a casual observation of daily life in this country supports Mr. Rau's complaint about all the complaining. Berlin, where the cafes are crowded, Philharmonic Hall is always sold out and parades of the larger model BMW's and Mercedes-Benzes take place continuously on the opulent Kurf\u00fcrstendam and the splendidly refurbished Unter den Linden, does not convey the impression of decline.\nYet the mood, clearly, is bad. The left-of-center coalition government of Chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der has about the lowest poll results of any recent chancellor. If a new election were held now, the opposition conservatives would be swept into power in a landslide. If that does happen in 2006 when elections will be held -- and many political experts believe that it will -- Germany could potentially be following the pattern of the United States after the Carter malaise and Britain in the depressing years before Margaret Thatcher in opting for a conservative revolution.\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

There are experts here who contend that the pessimism is actually a reasonable response to an objectively bad situation. ''The economic situation is really more of a problem than in other countries because so many shocks have come together,'' said Hans-Werner Sinn, the director of the Institute for Economic Research in Munich.\nAmong the shocks: the reunification of the two halves of the country, which was enormously expensive for the West but has not created an economically viable eastern half; the realization that the country just cannot afford the social-welfare spending that has been among its greatest achievements; and, perhaps most lastingly, the fear that with the imminent enlargement of the European Union, a lot of far cheaper countries to the East -- Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and the Baltic states -- are going to draw industries and jobs away from Germany.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nIn other words, Germans are gloomy because there is a general realization that the formulas that have worked so well for this country in the decades after World War II are not working anymore, and nobody knows exactly what to do. It is in that mood of semiparalysis that a conservative revolution seems possible.\nOf course, it is far too early to see if that will happen, and, if it does, it will happen despite a palpable public aversion to Thatcherite reforms. But among experts especially, there is a growing feeling that Germany needs some strong medicine if it is to overcome its difficulties, and strong medicine in Germany would mean something genuinely historic for Europe: a dismantling of the elaborate welfare state in the Continent's biggest and economically most powerful country that would surely reverberate in the other welfare states of Europe.\n''Germans have awakened from their dreams of the eternal welfare state,'' Mr. Sinn said, explaining the gloomy national mood, and giving it an objective basis. ''They've been confronted with reality, and that is never nice.''\nCorrection: April 8, 2004, Thursday An article on March 24 about a general mood of complaint in Germany referred incorrectly to former President Jimmy Carter's description of a similar mood in the United States in 1979. In a speech that year, Mr. Carter discussed a ''crisis of the American spirit,'' but he did not use the word ''malaise.''.LETTER FROM EUROPE; Listen to the Germans: Oh, What a Sorry State We're In", "Connecticut University defeats Auburn University, 79-53, to advance to NCAA tournament women's East Regional semifinals; photos (M)The Tigers kept it close in the first half with strong shooting of their own.

Perhaps I've developed a special protective sense that has allowed me to avoid the plague of D.J. booths that some restaurants offer along with a menu. But even allowing for my ability to taste the air the way a snake does, to steer clear of ear assaults, my surprising experience recently has been that restaurants are putting more consideration into the aural landscape.\nAt the Spotted Pig, a packed new hangout in the West Village where music is part of the restaurant's DNA, the background soundtrack actually inspires conversation rather than overpowering it. Ken Friedman, the operating partner, is a veteran of the music industry and he personally puts together soundtracks, which he burns onto CD's or programs on his iPod. Inevitably, diners throughout the small room start to ask him questions about the music playing or make requests. At one dinner, the playlist became the central focus at my table as we tried to guess what we were hearing and enjoying.\nOne night, the songs ran from White Stripes and Johnny Cash to the Smiths, the Clash and Jay-Z. Another night, Mr. Friedman played Air, a French pop group, before segueing into a homage to Apple Records (Badfinger and Mary Hopkin, but no Beatles), and then to some reggae dubs.\nBut even though the sound system at the Spotted Pig was clearly powerful enough to take over the room, it was kept at a reasonable volume throughout the night. And Mr. Friedman is taking steps to ensure that that will always be the case. He is installing a second sound system so that if people on one side of the dining room find it too loud, he can turn the music down there while leaving the volume alone on the other side.\n''Charlie Rose comes in several nights a week and never wants to sit near a speaker; it's just too loud for him,'' Mr. Friedman said. ''I used to turn the whole thing down. Now, I can sit him over here and turn it down, but keep it up over there.''\nIf ever there were a restaurant where the music would be predictably overwrought, you would think it would be Barbuto, a new rustic Italian trattoria in the Industria Superstudio on Washington Street, where the room is all hard surfaces, the clientele is primarily young and fashionable, and the executive chef is Jonathan Waxman, whose restaurants have always been known for what Bryan Miller once called the ''racket level.'' Astoundingly, the first time I put my head in Barbuto, in the thick of a Thursday night, no music was playing at all.\nWhen I eventually had dinner there, the music was barely discernable. Paradoxically, the bass notes of whatever was playing added texture to the room's ambient noise, helping to quiet the room by softening the ricocheting sounds of conversation. ''We usually have music, but when it gets noisier in the middle of the evening I usually turn it down,'' said Lynn McNeely, the chef de cuisine and general manager. ''We definitely don't want to fight with the customers.''\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nAt Bivio, another Italian restaurant that recently opened in the Village, a disco beat played sedately in the background one recent night, though the dining room was so crowded and the tables so close together that the noise level was high regardless. At the Harrison in TriBeCa, the Red Cat in Chelsea and the Mermaid Inn in the East Village, a group of stylish restaurants owned by Jimmy Bradley and Danny Abrams, the music is always present but rarely intrusive. Mr. Bradley says that he and Mr. Abrams monitor the music carefully.\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n''If a room isn't full and bustling, you have to be very, very careful with the music,'' Mr. Bradley said.\nIt's the rare restaurant that plays no music. Usually these are high-end temples -- like Chanterelle, for example -- that don't want any distraction from the food. My own preference would be no music over loud music anytime. But that's about as promising a position to adopt as suggesting that society do away with television. Music in restaurants is a proven enhancer of mood, which of course is directly linked to the spending impulse, and so is here to stay.\n''Restaurants need good music for people to hang out longer,'' Mr. Bradley said. Much of the music at his three restaurants, from organ jazz at the Harrison to classic rock 'n' roll at the Red Cat and honky-tonk at the Mermaid Inn, comes from his and Mr. Abrams's collections. Mr. Bradley said they prefer creating their own playlists over subscribing to one of the numerous services that do that for restaurants.\n''I've tried them out, but they've always been personality-less,'' he said. ''If you have something like that it really sticks out. People notice the little details.''\nNo detail seems to escape the crowd at the Spotted Pig, and Mr. Friedman likes it that way. While he often puts together a playlist by day that he feels will carry through from early evening to late night, he ends up at night switching things around, depending on how people are reacting to the music.\n''I can just kind of tell,'' Mr. Friedman said. ''People are smiling, kind of bopping their heads. I get a lot of feedback, people asking me who's playing. It's more fun to stand behind the bar and take requests.''\nNo matter how a restaurant programs its music, it will not be able to satisfy everybody. Some people simply prefer not to have their conversational space intruded upon. Edward Schneider, an editor and translator, has learned the approach of most people who crave escape from the beat: go early. The noise level around 6:30 at Spice Market, Jean-Georges Vongerichten's new restaurant in the meatpacking district, Mr. Schneider allowed, ''wasn't as horribly loud as it might have been.''\nMr. Schneider made plain that it is not noise so much as background music that he dislikes. For the aural ambience alone, he says, Jean Georges is one of his favorite restaurants. ''It is not a quiet restaurant,'' he said, ''but the sound doesn't come from music but from the buzz of conversation, laughter -- a kind of audible index of the fun people are having.''\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nI'm sympathetic to his point of view, and even if things are changing, I'm hesitant to take anything for granted. Recently I stopped at La Bottega, another new Italian restaurant, this one in the Maritime Hotel in Chelsea. The music, an assemblage of Italian pop songs, seemed thoroughly at one with the bustling, casual atmosphere, the buzz of the crowd and the pleasing fragrance of wood smoke coming from the oven. ''They've got it just right,'' I thought, until I stepped across a courtyard to the restaurant's cafe wing, where it serves pizzas and drinks. There, next to the bar, behind a marble counter, was a D.J.'s booth. It was not operating, though.

One commission member, former Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, greeted Dr. Albright by saying, ''It's very nice to see you again,'' but did not spare his fellow Democrat from a painful and pointed line of questioning.\n''I keep hearing the excuse, 'We didn't have actionable intelligence,' '' Mr. Kerrey said, describing the Clinton administration's frustrated failures to eliminate Mr. bin Laden in the years after the embassy bombings and the first World Trade Center attack, in 1993. ''Well, what the hell does that say to Al Qaeda? Basically, they knew, at the beginning of 1993, it seems to me, that there was going to be limited, if any, use of military, and that they were also free to do whatever they wanted.''\nDr. Albright responded that the Clinton administration had moved to freeze assets, apply diplomatic pressure and order airstrikes. Then she added: ''You, Senator, I know, were the only person that I know of who suggested declaring war. You were, you know, in retrospect, you were probably right.''\nFrom the sinking of the Titanic to the bombing of Pearl Harbor to the presidential commission set up to study urban unrest in the 1960's and the 1970's Senate inquiry into intelligence abuses by the C.I.A. and F.B.I., public and Congressional panels have delved into some of the most calamitous events in American history. But usually after the fact. Tuesday's hearing made it clear that the threat of terrorism remains ever present.\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\nFor the Clinton administration officials, this week's hearings were a chance to defend actions -- or lapses -- that have already passed into history. For the Bush appointees, the stakes were a good deal higher: They hope to keep making history for another four years. A year to the day after the capture of Pfc. Jessica Lynch in Iraq, cable television screens were filled not so much with images of combat as with recrimination and regret -- a blend that poses delicate challenges for Mr. Bush.\n''These things are very unusual, and only come after great national disasters,'' said Richard N. Goodwin, the former speechwriter for President John F. Kennedy who as a young lawyer served on the staff of the Congressional inquiry into the rigging of television quiz shows. ''Especially in an election year, the political stakes are high. There's an enormous amount of tension and pent-up passions and political rivalry. But, thank God, we have these ritual forms. In the 1850's, half the guys in Congress were carrying revolvers on the floor.''\nFor relatives of the Sept. 11 victims, the hearing was a chance, finally, to get the public attention that they believe the commission's work has long lacked. They came with still-broken hearts and photographs of the dead, seeking answers they did not quite expect to receive.\n''I want the truth,'' said Bob McIlvaine, whose son, Bobby, died in the attacks. He wore a green jacket and a pained look, and carried a copy of Craig Unger's book, ''House of Bush, House of Saud: The Secret Relationship Between the World's Two Most Powerful Dynasties'' (Scribner, 2004). ''I don't think this commission is going to be asking the questions that need to be asked.''\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nPaul D. Wolfowitz, the deputy defense secretary, who was seated next to Mr. Rumsfeld, also wore a pained expression for much of the afternoon. He rejected any suggestion that the Bush administration had taken too long -- until September 2001 -- to devise a plan for dealing with Al Qaeda and the Taliban.\n''A plan is not a military option,'' Mr. Wolfowitz told the panel. ''A military option is to a plan what a single play in football is to a whole game plan, and this notion that there's a single thing that if we had only done it, it would work, is like a Hail Mary pass in football, which is what a desperate, losing team does in a hope that maybe they can pull things off at the end. A plan has got to anticipate what the enemy will do next.''\nThe commission was created by Congress with Mr. Bush's reluctant assent and is scheduled to conclude its business this summer. But Tuesday's hearing was a sign that Mr. Bush ought to be anticipating what comes next. He already has his hands full with the continued fighting in Iraq, and the threat of more attacks at home, and the history of past panels might give him pause.\n''The Kerner Commission on inner-city riots was appointed by Lyndon Johnson as a way of defusing the issue,'' the presidential historian Robert Dallek recalled. ''But its report became a very public document, and in the end Johnson was very unhappy with it, because he feared it would lead to greater demands for spending on antipoverty programs. And he was trying to get a tax increase to finance the Vietnam War.''THREATS AND RESPONSES: NEWS ANALYSIS; For a Day, Terrorism Transcends Politics as Commission Examines Failures", "William C Rhoden Sports of The Times column discusses Sports Belle apparel manufacturing company, which fears that St Joseph's University's success in NCAA tournament could end partnership with school if it decides it has outgrown small Kentucky uniform maker; photo (M)''But I just hope we can keep St. Joe's as a Sports Belle team. Sometimes they have to do what's best businesswise.''\nDon DiJulia, the St. Joseph's athletic director, said Lee's thinking was premature.\n''He's way, way ahead of himself,'' DiJulia said on Monday from Philadelphia. ''The farthest thing from our mind is what shoe we're going to wear, what socks we're going to buy, what jocks we're going to order. Who knows? We're like ''Hoosiers'' and ''Seabiscuit'' all at once.''\nLee has seen what happens when a client becomes too large. He said he lost two clients this year to larger companies. He was also stung by the University of Tennessee in 1997 after more than a decade of doing business with it.\n''We made uniforms for U.T. for 12 years: football, baseball and basketball,'' he said. Then Adidas swooped in and signed a multiyear deal with the university; Lee said Sports Belle was eventually phased out.\nLee first saw St. Joseph's in 1996, in the final of the National Invitation Tournament at Madison Square Garden. He saw what the team was wearing and thought it needed help.\n''They were playing with some uniforms that I was taken aback by,'' Lee said. ''I thought they would have been much nicer. I told my sales rep: 'Get that coach. Let's sit down and talk. We need to get together. That school and our company go together.' ''\nThe coach was Phil Martelli and his program has been with Sports Belle ever since, although the team wears Nike sneakers.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nThe ultimate decision to stay or to leave will be made at levels above him, but Martelli said he liked the idea of being a lone wolf. With virtually every team in the N.C.A.A. tournament wearing Nike, Reebok or Adidas, St. Joe's uniforms have a distinctive look. Martelli watched the Pittsburgh-Wisconsin game on Sunday and noticed that the teams were wearing the same style of uniforms.\n''They both had Adidas uniforms,'' he said, ''but it was the exact same uniform. I was sitting there thinking, 'Shouldn't a uniform be like some kind of expression about your uniqueness?'\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

''I would hate to be stuck in the Xerox machine and it comes out and somebody would say, 'I don't know if it's St. Joe's or St. Louis or San Jose State, because the uniforms all look the same.' ''\nLee doesn't pay coaches to wear his gear. Unlike the conglomerates, Sports Belle doesn't give its products away. ''This is a for-profit organization, and we have to sell,'' Lee said. ''I don't have the money to tie up in shoes or warm-ups or whatever else. We sell uniforms, and my money has to come from there. It doesn't come from around the world. It comes from right here.''\nLee, who attended the University of Tennessee, cut his teeth as a designer for the sports apparel firm Southern Athletic. He left the company in 1974 after nine and a half years, largely because the company didn't grasp the significance to the apparel industry of Title IX, the legislation that was passed in 1972 that prohibits sex discrimination in education programs receiving federal aid.\n''I tried to tell them: 'Here's what's coming: The girls are coming,' '' Lee said. ''They wanted a girl to wear a man's uniform.''\nLee formed Sports Belle in 1974 and began making uniforms for girls' and boys' high school teams. This year, Sports Belle had eight women's teams in the 64-team N.C.A.A. Division I tournament and only St. Joseph's in the men's tournament.\nClearly, St. Joseph's is the belle of the March Madness ball. Lee's nightmare is that St. Joseph's may not leave with the partner it brought to the ball. This is a microcosm of reality: the underdog gets big and leaves the yard.\n''I really don't think they will leave Sports Belle,'' Lee said. ''I would be surprised if they did, but if they do, I have to be realistic. I want St. Joe's to do what's best for their program. They're not like a lot of schools that get a lot of things given to them, here, there and everywhere in the country.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n''People will jump on the bandwagon now, but have they seen the program evolve from the last five to eight years? That's where I've been.''\nThough administrators at St. Joseph's say Lee should calm down, they're not exactly saying he shouldn't worry.\n''If somebody walked in and said, 'Here's a million dollars,' yeah, I'll come to the meeting,'' DiJulia said. ''No question about it, I'll come to the meeting. But that doesn't mean anything; just means we'll go to the meeting.''\nYou never stray too far from the bottom line in intercollegiate athletics. Everything's a balancing act: the big picture and the long term versus loyalty and the here and now.\nI like the St. Joseph's story, and I like it even more with an independent company providing clothes for the dream. My advice to the university is to keep the faith: stay with a fellow underdog. By any means necessary, resist the swoosh.Sports of The Times; Clothier Fears Team May Outgrow Him", "Frank J Prial Wine Talk column describes 13th annual San Francisco Zinfandel Festival, where enthusiastic fans tasted more than 550 wines offered by about 275 wineries; photo (M)At the first ZAP tasting, in 1992, 22 wineries poured their wares for a small group of zinfandel fans. It was the kind of tasting that goes on every week in San Francisco, virtually unnoticed. But this one grew. Today ZAP claims 6,000 advocates and 310 producer members.\nAlmost all zinfandel comes from California. Small amounts are made in Oregon, Washington and New Zealand. Similar wines are made in Italy and Croatia. In Italy, the grape and the wine are called primitivo. Most of the wines poured at the big tasting were bottled ones from the 2001 vintage. Many producers also offered barrel samples, wines not yet bottled, from 2002.\nAside from showcasing zinfandel, ZAP finances research on the grape's provenance and history and covers most of the operating budget for the Zinfandel Heritage Vineyard in Oakville, in the Napa Valley, where zinfandel vines are gathered from all over California to study and preserve. Some of these vines are more than 100 years old.\nPart of zinfandel's appeal is its long connection with America. For years it was known as this country's only native vinifera vine. Cabernet sauvignon, merlot, pinot noir and chardonnay all have traceable European origins.\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

But myths die hard, and having taken zinfandel as our own, we are, it would appear, reluctant to give it up.\nZinfandel was long considered a second-tier grape, suitable mostly for jug wines. It was a major constituent in wines like Gallo's Hearty Burgundy. Later, producers like Ridge Vineyards showed that it could be fashioned into wines with elegance and complexity. Today's winemakers turn the grape into a remarkable array of wines, from light and simple styles to wines that are intense and long-lived. In recent years, old-vine zinfandels have been popular; so have high-alcohol wines, some of them containing 16.5 and 17 percent alcohol (most table wines have a 12.5 to 14 percent alcohol content).\nThough many of the zins poured at the festival were alcoholic monsters, many seemed less massive than in former years, wrote Paul Franson, who publishes a newsletter about the Napa Valley. That was either because of climatic conditions or of restraint on the part of winemakers who may recognize that big isn't always better.\nMany of the wines, in fact, were more like the friendly zins of yore, though that wasn't what most festival attendees were seeking, Mr. Franson wrote.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nCalling the wines zins is part of zinfandel's populist image. Winemakers cannot resist the slightly louche effect that comes from rhyming zin with sin. Names that have appeared over the years include Original Zin, Mortal Zin and, in the case of wordsmith-winemaker Randall Grahm, Cardinal Zin, Made from Gnarly Old Vines.\nFor zinfandel lovers who can't make it to San Francisco for the annual bacchanal, ZAP takes its show on the road. As road shows go, it's a big one.\nThis year, some 50 wineries will pour new releases for their fans in five cities beginning with New York on April 22, where they will pitch their tent, figuratively speaking, at the 200 Fifth Club at 200 Fifth Avenue. Ticket information is available at www.zinfandel.org.\nThe road show offers less wine than the main event in San Francisco, but no one is likely to complain about being limited to 50 wines. In addition, there is the usual detritus of fan-oriented events, including caps, T-shirts and the like. A zinfandel T-shirt says something about the wine's laid-back image. I ask you, who could conceive of a cabernet sauvignon T-shirt?WINE TALK; Taking the Party on the Road", "INTERNATIONAL A3-12 New Leader of Hamas Is Known for Militancy The Palestinian Islamic movement Hamas selected one of its most combative figures, Dr. Abdel Aziz Rantisi, as its leader in the Gaza Strip following Israel's killing of the group's founder, Sheik Ahmed Yassin.

Mercer Kitchen serves good food with nods to Asia, but it is dark and unforgivingly loud. A little more than a year ago, Mr. Vongerichten made a breakthrough with Chinese cooking at 66: rather than giving French food an Asian flair, he gave Chinese dishes a dose of his exquisite minimalism. But the dining room at 66 is like a hip morgue, and it has failed to woo serious diners.\nSince then, Mr. Vongerichten seems to have had an epiphany. He is not a club owner, but a sensualist. And at Spice Market, he has hit on something new: casual, exotic luxury and food that people want to eat.\nThat food is street food -- a gastronomical genre that is regarded by some as the best in the world. Only here it is reworked and polished. Egg rolls stuffed with mushrooms gleam under Mr. Vongerichten's touch. Softened shiitake and oyster mushrooms are loosely swaddled in a wrapper that is fragile and crisp on the outside. A tangy herbal galangal sauce is whipped into a celadon foam. When you dip the egg rolls, the sauce clings in a light, loose layer. Vietnamese spring rolls stuffed with pork, mushroom and shrimp are more rigidly constructed, and are fried stiff. A waiter instructs you to wrap the roll in lettuce with fresh mint and coriander and to dip it in a sweet lime and rice vinegar broth. A succession of stimulating textures and vivid flavors -- first the lettuce and herbs, then the crackle of the rolls, with their pillowy filling -- flutter on your palate.\nMany dishes are street food as invented by Spice Market. If this seems to be taking too much liberty, you must remind yourself of the headwaiter in the Letterman T-shirt. This isn't a precise cultural tour. This is a Vongerichten fantasy.\nAnd in that fantasy, fat tapioca pearls loom large. They are simmered with Thai chilies, Sichuan peppercorns, cinnamon and chipotle, then paired with slivers of raw tuna in a cool coconut broth sharpened with kaffir lime. The dish is eaten with a spoon.\nFried squid is piled atop a salad of papaya, water chestnut and cashews. Sweet shrimp fritters are dotted with crunchy bits of long bean and tempered by a relish of peanut and cucumber cut into minuscule cubes.\nThai chicken wings are lined up on a plate, coated in a hot, sticky sauce, fragrant with chilies, soy, lime and fish sauce. Between the wings, your chopsticks make their way to slices of mango, there for relief.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nThe chicken wings are one of the few dishes motivated by heat. Mr. Vongerichten uses heat judiciously. In red curried duck, the warmth offsets a rich coconut and lemon grass broth, and in pork vindaloo, red finger chilies balance a powerful blend of cumin, ginger, garlic, cinnamon and cardamom.\nIt is easy to become overstimulated by all the flavors. No detail eludes Mr. Vongerichten's experimental mind. Even the ginger ale is homemade. An extract of ginger, sugar and lime is blended with club soda -- a drink with perfect zip.\nThere are plenty of good beers and a brief but interesting list of wines, but it would be a shame to miss the cocktails. A blood orange mojito is fresh tasting and herbal, and the splash of acidity makes it an affable partner to the food. It is difficult not to slug it back. Order a Pattaya if you are feeling the need for discipline. It screams with passion fruit but is delicately bubbly.\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address.

View all New York Times newsletters.\nI found myself reveling over soothing dishes like ginger rice, a dish that was never meant to thrill but does here. The rice is firm, each round bead glazed in oil and fragrant with garlic and scallion. An egg cooked sunny side up with ginger and garlic is flipped onto the rice. As you dip your spoon into it, the egg spreads and coats the rice grains, making them creamy, lovely.\nBut the dish that explains why Spice Market is such an extraordinary pleasure is Thai jewels.

The writer was Amanda Hesser, The Times's interim restaurant critic. Last May, before her assignment to that post, Ms. Hesser published a book, ''Cooking for Mr. Latte,'' that was praised in a jacket blurb by the restaurateur Jean-Georges Vongerichten, who later opened Spice Market. He wrote: ''Amanda Hesser's charming personality shines as the reader experiences the life and loves of a New York City gourmet. 'Cooking for Mr. Latte' is perfectly seasoned with sensuality and superb recipes.'' The review should have disclosed that background.RESTAURANTS; Fancy Street Food, but What a Street", "Anita Gates reviews HBO documentary A Boy's Life, directed by Rory Kennedy; photo (M)''I think what we've got here is two Roberts,'' his principal, Vicky Beckham, tells Anna Threadgill, Robert's grandmother, during a home visit. Anna is not pleased by the suggestion that her grandson's teachers can control him but she cannot, and she reacts with a veiled version of her deadly modus operandi.\nWhen Ms. Beckham assures Robert that he has everything he needs for success, and specifically that he is intelligent and nice-looking, Anna responds immediately, taking on her grandson's voice: '' 'I'm good-looking, and all the kids are jealous of me, and they all call me ugly,' '' she says. ''But say, 'I know I'm good-looking.' ''\nIf this is Anna's good behavior for the camera, one shudders to imagine how she treats Robert when Ms. Kennedy and Mr. Doob leave. And you don't have to have grown up on welfare to recognize and be outraged by the pain that an emotionally abusive parent or guardian can inflict. Poverty and a culture that discourages hope only magnify young victims' helplessness.\nWhen Anna mentions that her father was a full-blooded Comanche, Robert goes into his tough-guy act, saying: ''Give me a bow and arrow. I need to shoot myself.'' His grandmother responds by handing him a pistol (unloaded at least) and then ridiculing him. ''You can't even shoot Mamaw's gun,'' she says.\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter.

When Robert wins a race with Benji, she declares Benji the winner instead and says, ''Robert, you don't know how to run.''\nBy the end of the film you have to cringe whenever Anna touches Robert. He cringes, too, thank goodness.\nRobert's mother, Robanna Fason, was 15 when she became pregnant as a result of rape. She was running with a ''bad crowd,'' she says. ''They got me on drugs and some kind of something that made me where I didn't know what my name was.''\nRobanna doesn't take care of her children, she says, because she is sick. ''I'll stand in the store for five minutes, and my legs go to hurting,'' she says by way of example of her condition, also mentioning pneumonia, seizures and thyroid problems. When she seeks medical attention, though, Anna ridicules and discourages it.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nAnna has problems herself. Dr. Virginia Fee, Robert's state-appointed therapist, concludes that Anna has something like Munchausen syndrome by proxy, inducing symptoms of emotional illness in Robert. The film suggests that Anna despises him because his arrival destroyed Anna's dreams for her daughter. She had planned for Robanna to be a beauty queen and a model, even though Robanna, in her early 20's, is obese and missing several front teeth.\nDuring the film the best thing that happens to Robert is that Anna goes into the hospital, and that leads to some changes. It is unclear exactly how ill she is or how much her mind is influencing her body, but when on her sickbed Anna promises Robert that she will see him again in heaven, it sounds like a threat.\nA BOY'S LIFE\nHBO, tonight at 7:30, Eastern and Pacific times; 6:30, Central time\nProduced and directed by Rory Kennedy; Liz Garbus, producer; Nick Doob, co-director and director of photography; Charlton McMillan, editor; Joel Goodman, original music; Mark Bailey, story editor; Nancy Abraham, supervising producer for HBO; Sheila Nevins, executive producer for HBO.

Galante, who served as the national spokesman in the Roman Catholic Church's effort to deal with sexual abuse by priests, was appointed yesterday as bishop of the Camden Diocese, which has its own history of costly settlements for sexual abuse. A native of Philadelphia, Bishop Galante, 65, was appointed by the pope after serving as coadjutor bishop of Dallas since 2000.\nBishop Galante was the national spokesman for the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops that set guidelines in 2002 for dealing with claims of sexual abuse by priests. The guidelines included a ''one-strike'' rule that removed clergymen who committed sexual abuse.\nIn Camden, Bishop Galante will lead a diocese of 450,000 that was significantly affected by the priest abuse scandal. The diocese paid $5.7 million in legal settlements for sexual abuse cases mostly occurring from the 1960's through the 80's.\n''I'm sure his background played a role in the decision,'' said Barbara Polesir, director of the South Jersey chapter of the Survivors Network of Those Abused by Priests.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nMs. Polesir said that while individuals in her group were wary of the appointment, they decided as a group that they would take a diplomatic approach, welcoming the bishop. She specifically cited as troubling Bishop Galante's statement to a newspaper in 2002 that a Dallas church, and not the diocese, was at fault in a case in which two men pleaded guilty to sexually abusing young girls.\nThe director of the survivors network in Philadelphia, John Salveson, said in a phone interview that the organization was eager to work with Bishop Galante and thought he had shown ''small signs of promise'' while in Dallas. He cited in particular Bishop Galante's criticism in 2002 that Bishop Charles Grahmann of Dallas had been slow to respond to an accusation of sexual abuse by a priest. Bishop Galante did not respond to requests for an interview yesterday, but in a statement he said: ''This is truly a return home for me. I was born, raised, and educated in the Delaware Valley -- albeit on the other side of the river. Although I left this area in 1987, I have maintained a home at the shore since 1983.

RealNetworks, which led the way in music software, could face a similar fate. It is not easy to make money off a product that consumers must install themselves when the consumers already own Microsoft's version, which comes already installed.\nIn the United States, a federal judge ruled in 2000 that Microsoft had violated antitrust law and ordered it split in two, separating the operating system from the rest of the company. But that ruling was partly overturned on appeal, and the company later settled with the Justice Department on terms that left it free to pursue expansion of the operating system.\nIn an ideal world, decisions on which features to use would be made at an industry level, like the manufacturer level, where there is competition. Just as General Motors, Ford and other automakers deal with many of the same suppliers for everything from seats to transmissions, and choose which to put on any given model, Dell, Hewlett-Packard and other computer makers could decide among competing offerings from Microsoft and other companies.\nThe manufacturers would be competing, presumably, on the basis of functionality and price. The consumer would be able to buy machines with everything already loaded, but different vendors would decide just what combination they wanted to offer and would do the work of integrating the programs.\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

To make that work, Microsoft would have to sell different versions of Windows, some with features bundled in and others without them. And their prices would have to be set at levels that made fair competition possible.\nThere is no clear way to accomplish that, short of government regulation, utility-style. Mario Monti, the European Union's chief antitrust regulator, sought a deal that would give regulators a say in what was added to the operating system in the future, but Microsoft was unwilling to give in. It is possible that when the commission issues its final decision on Wednesday it will order such changes in addition to the fine, whose size was reported by people close to Microsoft on Monday. The company has said it will appeal, a process that could take years.\nIn the United States, efforts to foster competition in areas that were deemed natural monopolies have had a mixed record of success, at best. In the local telephone market, would-be competitors have had to use local phone company lines, at prices set by regulators. There is a parallel in the personal computer industry, where those who seek to compete with systems that Microsoft uses in its operating system must use the same operating system and can hope to be price-competitive only as a result of government intervention.\nMicrosoft has managed to fend off such moves in the past, and may do so again as the European case continues on appeal. But it will face renewals of such fights time and again, as innovations prompt protests from injured competitors. The net effect of serial investigations and antitrust cases could be to make Microsoft act like a regulated utility, whatever its legal status is.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nSuch companies may be quite profitable and pay high dividends -- far better than the current Microsoft payout of less than 1 percent -- but they do not get priced as growth stocks. Microsoft's sheer size makes exponential growth impossible anyway, but the notion of governments watching over every new Microsoft innovation, prepared to challenge it if it seems unfair to some competitor, is a daunting one.\nMicrosoft was down 35 cents, to $24.15, in trading in New York yesterday, leaving it up just 10 percent from where it was when the stock market hit bottom on Oct. 9, 2002. Over that same period, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index is up 41 percent, and the Goldman Sachs software index has risen 81 percent.\nMeasuring from the bottom may seem unfair to Microsoft, since it did not fall as far as many stocks did during the bear market and therefore had less ground to make up. But the fact is that over the last year, Microsoft has traded in a range of $23.60 to $30, a low-to-high difference of only 27 percent, the smallest range in Microsoft's history. And over that year, while most stocks have risen, Microsoft is down 9 percent.Market Place; Microsoft as a high-tech variant of an old-style utility?

New York Life plans to keep using the 925,000-square-foot building as its headquarters, according to a company spokesman, William Werfelman. It wants to lease 290,000 square feet, however, because it is diversifying its offices to a 383,000-square-foot building it bought last year in what had been the Mount Pleasant Executive Center in Sleepy Hollow, N.Y., about four miles north of the Tappan Zee bridge in Westchester County.\nAccording to Cushman & Wakefield, the brokerage and services company that has begun quietly marketing the 51 Madison Avenue space, it is the second-largest block of high-quality office space currently available in Midtown South, after the 372,000 square feet at 330 Hudson Street.\nWhile prospects for New York's overall office market remain subdued, Paul Glickman and A. Mitti Liebersohn, the two leasing agents for the 51 Madison Avenue property, say they expect the space to attract Midtown companies that like the Madison Square Park area but have been unable to move there because of a shortage of large blocks of amenity-laden space.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nAccording to Cushman & Wakefield, demand for high-quality office space in the Madison Square Park area is strong, and rental rates are on the rise for large blocks of space in prominent buildings.

James Yee, the former Muslim chaplain at Guant\u00e1namo, was arrested on suspicion of espionage, the military has dropped the charges. Military officials insist that the prosecution was halted only to keep sensitive information from becoming public. What they really are trying to hide from view, it seems clear, is not national security secrets, but the incompetence and mean-spiritedness of their prosecution.\nCaptain Yee was arrested last September after inspectors found what they claimed were suspicious, perhaps classified, papers in his luggage. Captain Yee spent 76 days in a naval brig, much of the time in leg irons, and prosecutors suggested that they might seek the death penalty. As the investigation proceeded, it became evident just how weak the accusations were. The military downgraded the charges to mishandling classified data. But it added charges that Captain Yee had engaged in an extramarital affair and had kept pornography on his government computer.\nAt a hearing in December, the government revealed that it had never bothered to make a formal determination that the documents Captain Yee was charged with carrying were actually classified. The hearing was adjourned so prosecutors could make this basic determination. But before it was, the government made public the more salacious charges. As Captain Yee's wife and 4-year-old daughter looked on, a fellow officer testified under a grant of immunity about having an affair with him.\nIn dropping the prosecution last week, the military refused to clear Captain Yee, contending that it had acted only because of ''national security concerns that would arise from the release of the evidence.'' But there is no reason to believe this is true. Lawyers on both sides had security clearances, and sensitive evidence, if any existed, could have been kept confidential. In a final unpleasant touch, rather than letting go of the accusations of possessing pornography and having an affair, the military formally reprimanded Captain Yee this week, based on those allegations. These are matters the military rarely investigates. The reprimand appears to be the military's feeble attempt to make Captain Yee look bad.\nThe case raises many questions -- not about Captain Yee, but about his accusers. Did Captain Yee's position as a Muslim chaplain make him suspect in the eyes of the military, even in the absence of significant evidence? Why did prosecutors begin their case before determining whether the information at issue was classified? Why were embarrassing sexual allegations included, and emphasized, in a case that claimed to be about national security?\nThe damage this case did to Captain Yee is incalculable, but the military has also hurt itself. It has cast further doubt on its detention policies in Guant\u00e1namo. It has diminished public confidence in military justice. And it has weakened its own credibility for future cases when it tries to invoke national security. For Captain Yee's sake and its own, the military should apologize for its misguided prosecution and put in place procedures to prevent a case like this from happening again.Military Injustice", "Same-sex couples who have become parents are increasingly confronting custody disputes that arise after breakup; legal landscape surrounding such breakups is often uncertain or uncharted since laws were not written to anticipate same-sex situations; trauma and confusion suffered by children in conventional divorces can be magnified for children who have grown up with same-sex parents or who are product of earlier heterosexual relationships; photo (M)As tens of thousands of same-sex couples become parents, they are increasingly confronting what heterosexual parents have long dealt with: remaking their lives and those of their children after a breakup.\nBut for gays and lesbians, the legal landscape surrounding such breakups is often uncertain or uncharted. Laws, ill fitting and varying by state, were not written to anticipate same-sex situations, and judges often take interpretative license as they struggle to navigate a rocky path.\nThe children are caught in the middle, and for many, the trauma and confusion of conventional divorce can be magnified. Judges have weighed in on issues like whether a former partner should pay child support, and how the children should be told of or shielded from a parent's homosexuality.\n''Courts are struggling with the whole definition of what is an American family today,'' said John Mayoue, author of ''Competing Interests in Family Law.'' ''It's a cultural thing. There's very little law and very little regulation.''\nThe judge in the twins' custody case, Randolph E. Heubach of Marin County Superior Court, wrote, ''The court recognizes the harsh consequences this decision will visit upon the innocent children born of the parties' unusual arrangement.'' He said he deeply regretted that the evidence did not allow him to rule otherwise.\nThere are several reasons no legal road map exists for cases involving same-sex couples with children. Courts have been slow to address the status of children being raised by unmarried couples, straight or gay; advances in medical technologies have moved faster than the courts; and judges and legislators have had mixed reactions to the idea of gay couples as parents.\nAs a result, judicial rulings vary widely. The judge in the E and K case based his decision largely on a release form that K, whose uterus could not support a pregnancy, had signed, waiving her right to adopt when her eggs were harvested. The judge did not uphold K's claims that she considered the form only an obligatory permission slip so the fertility clinic could give her eggs to E, who could not produce viable ovum. K is appealing the ruling.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nIn other cases, judges have focused less on documents, many of which were not particularly tailored to same-sex couples. Those judges have relied more on the parental intent of the partners, and their relationships with the children.\nAccording to the census, at least 600,000 same-sex couples are living together, about evenly split between men and women, but experts say such relationships are undercounted. The census also says about 60,000 female couples and 15,000 male couples live with a child, and in the vast majority, only one member of the couple has a legal relationship with the child.\nMany of these children are the products of earlier heterosexual relationships, and often, courts allow a divorced man or woman who is now gay to share child custody. But not always, and courts sometimes condition custody and visitation orders on shielding the child from the homosexual relationship. In January, for instance, a Tennessee appeals court forbade an estranged husband from ''exposing the child to his gay lover(s) and/or his gay lifestyle.''\nIn Idaho Falls, a father, Theron McGriff, initially shared legal and physical custody of his two daughters. Months after divorcing in 1997, Mr. McGriff said in an interview, he realized he was gay and, in 2000, his partner moved into the house they jointly own. Mr. McGriff's former wife, Shawn Weingartner, then went to court seeking sole physical custody with visitation for Mr. McGriff.\nMs. Weingartner and her lawyer declined to be interviewed, but in her petition she cited ''the ages of the children, the fact that they are approaching puberty, the fact that they are girls, the fact that Mr. McGriff is now in a homosexual relationship with another man, the fact that Mr. McGriff has failed to deal with his homosexuality in a responsible and emotionally stable manner.''\nThe judge, Magistrate L. Mark Riddoch of Bonneville County, awarded Ms. Weingartner both sole legal and physical custody, allowing the children to visit Mr. McGriff only if he was not living with his partner.\n''Father's homosexuality may not influence his/her parenting ability per se, and this court does not decide the custody and visitation issues on that basis,'' the judge wrote. ''However, father's decision to openly co-habit with'' his partner ''is a change in circumstances which needed to be jointly communicated to the girls in an appropriate manner. It is a change that will generate questions from the girls and their friends regarding their father's lifestyle. Moreover, father has minimized this issue in regard to the conservative culture and mores in which the children live.''\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

''My youngest daughter said to me, 'Daddy, God didn't make enough time for me to get used to this,' '' meaning, the inability to spend equal time with both parents.\n''I told them that we could live like this or we could fight it,'' said Mr. McGriff, adding that the children, ages 9 and 13, had now known his partner for nearly seven years. ''They said, 'Daddy, you don't have a choice. You've got to fight it.' ''\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nMany cases of breakups by same-sex couples involve adoption laws, since often, at least one parent has adopted the child. But the status of the second parent is less clear. Only nine states have explicitly allowed so-called second-parent adoptions for gay couples in decisions of their highest courts, four states prohibit them, and many others have not definitively addressed the issue.\nIn Denver, Dr. Elsey McLeod and Dr. Cheryl Clark were longtime lesbian partners until Dr. Clark became an evangelical Christian who now believes that homosexuality is a sin. For years, the women raised a girl they had brought back from China, who was adopted solely by Dr. Clark because Colorado does not allow second-parent adoption.\nLast year, a judge awarded shared custody to Dr. McLeod. And while he gave Dr. Clark control over the child's religious upbringing, he ordered that she not expose the girl to anything ''that can be considered homophobic.''\nGina Weitzenkorn, Dr. McLeod's lawyer, said her client ''was concerned that the church was homophobic, especially in the literature the church distributes.''\nThe judge's order, which Dr. Clark is appealing, has generated an outcry from religious conservatives, and last week, a state representative introduced a resolution to impeach the judge.\nJames Rouse, Dr. Clark's lawyer, said that even though his client had shared child-rearing responsibilities with Dr. McLeod, Dr. Clark should be allowed to ''change her mind as to what's best for the child.'' He added: ''Let's say you have a heterosexual couple and the mother finds out the boyfriend is an abuser or a drug addict. Is she required to keep that guy a part of the child's life?''\nIn Massachusetts, a court is considering another issue: Can a former same-sex partner who does not want responsibility for a child be compelled to pay child support? The case involves a woman, B. L., who participated in having her partner artificially inseminated, but broke up with her partner, T. F., before the child was born.\nSome recent cases suggest that the availability of gay marriage could lend clarity to often hopelessly confusing situations. But there is disagreement about that, too.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nIn the case of K and E, K said that the women, who were registered domestic partners, would have married if they could have, which would have most likely led a court to give them joint custody.\n''The way we lived our lives tells the story,'' said K, who said the twins look like her. ''We shared everything. Our nanny for five years never even knew which one had given the physical birth.''\nBut E's lawyer, Diana Richmond, said they would not have married, that the domestic partnership was only so K could join E's gym, and that E intended K's role to be akin to stepparent.\n''She did a lot of the caretaking, that's not in dispute,'' Ms. Richmond said about K. ''She functioned as a stepparent would function, and there's no question but that she loved the twins.'' But, Ms. Richmond said, granting shared custody would be ''trampling'' on E's rights and ''giving this woman greater rights than stepparents have.''\nIn any case, the permutations of the K v. E case would seem unlikely to apply to a heterosexual couple, married or not.\n''You have the egg mom and the womb mom,'' said Joan Hollinger, who teaches adoption law at the University of California, Berkeley. ''They're both natural mothers. One's biological and the other is genetic. Courts are issuing decisions about their dual maternity after ascertaining who intended to be the parent, and that makes me nervous.''\nCorrection: April 7, 2004, Wednesday An article on March 24 about the legal landscape for gay couples in custody disputes misstated the numbers of same-sex couples in the United States who have a child living with them. It is about 96,000 female couples and 66,000 male couples, not 60,000 female couples and 15,000 male couples.Split Gay Couples Face Custody Hurdles", "Only four of NCAA men's basketball tournament Round of 16 teams have graduation rates of 50 percent or better--Duke University, Kansas University, Vanderbilt University and Xavier University (M)Richard Lapchick, director of the Institute for Diversity and Ethics in Sport at the University of Central Florida, said that the new plan was overdue and that it could improve poor academic performance, especially in high-profile sports like basketball and football.\nIn his own studies over the previous 10 years, Lapchick has found, among other things, that more than 50 Division I basketball programs had failed to graduate even one black player.\n''This would be the first time ever the N.C.A.A. would hand out sanctions for schools that fail to deliver on the promise of an education when they open their doors to athletes,'' Lapchick said.\nYesterday, he released his survey, ''Keeping Score When It Counts: Graduation Rates and Diversity in Campus Leadership for 2004 Men's Sweet 16 Teams.''\n''There also are rewards for teams that do it right, which are not many if you look at the 16 teams,'' he said of the pending N.C.A.A. incentive/disincentive plan.\nOf the teams still left in the N.C.A.A. tournament, Kansas had the top graduation rate among players, at 73 percent, followed by Duke and Xavier at 67 percent and Vanderbilt at 62 percent.\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Those colleges, according to a separate study released by the Knight Foundation Commission on Intercollegiate Athletics, were Alabama; Alabama at Birmingham; Connecticut; Georgia Tech; Nevada; Oklahoma State; and Pittsburgh.\nThe N.C.A.A. did not release campus-specific graduation rates for 16 teams in the 65-field tournament. Those 16 colleges fell under the federal Department of Education's ruling last year that graduation rate information could not be published for a class in which there were fewer than three athletes on scholarships or fewer than three who graduated.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n''We feel uncomfortable, too, when we see these rates published, and agree with the new structure,'' said Jim Haney, executive director of the National Association of Basketball Coaches. ''We've all raised the bar academically, and when kids know how high the bar is set they'll go meet it.''\nThe Knight Commission chairman, William C. Friday, president emeritus of the University of North Carolina, said he was not so sure.\n''When you see poor graduation rates, recruiting violations and instances of academic fraud, any thoughtful sports fan can see that we've created an entertainment industry and, in the process, it has eroded the integrity of the university,'' Friday said.\n''It is a good first step, but it is going to take a lot more than that,'' he said of the proposed N.C.A.A. plan. ''We need to step back and take the pressure off college sports. That means getting some discipline back in our dealings with television networks and keeping coaches' salaries down. We are not honoring our moral duty to these student athletes.''\nIndeed, the graduation rates of athletes in revenue-generating sports like basketball are at variance with the performance of students in other sports.\nSixty-two percent of all scholarship athletes who entered Division I colleges for the 1996-97 academic year graduated in the six-year window allowed for such statistics. Only 42 percent of the players in men's basketball programs in Division I graduated, however.\n''There are some loopholes that haven't serve us well in sports like men's basketball,'' Brand said.

She said that Mr. Ammon had also been shocked on his back and neck by an electric stun gun, and that Mr. Pelosi had bought several stun guns before the killing.\nShe also said that on the night of the murder, Mr. Pelosi had somehow tapped into a video security system inside the mansion for more than 15 minutes shortly before 2 a.m., when Mr. Ammon is believed to have died.

Juan Antonio Samaranch delivered a highly uncharacteristic public scolding in 2000, saying that Athens was now operating on a yellow caution light, but he did not follow what may have been his instincts, to take the Games away.\n''It could have been done in 2001,'' Anita DeFrantz of the United States, a vice president of the I.O.C., said yesterday. ''I don't want to sound chauvinistic, but L.A. could have done it on short notice.''\nThe supervisor of the Coordination Commission in those days was Dr. Jacques Rogge of Belgium, who is now the president of the I.O.C. If these Games are seen as an embarrassment, the I.O.C. deserves the blame as much as Athens.\n''The Games will be fine,'' DeFrantz said. ''They may not be what was imagined. There may be temporary solutions. But the Games are about athletes winning medals.''\nIn the long view, Athens is a victim of conflicting impulses within the Olympic movement.\nThere is the admirable desire to make the Games accessible to smaller nations in all corners of the world. Athens was chosen in 1997 as ''a chance to get back to our roots,'' as Richard Pound of Canada, a major force on the I.O.C., said yesterday.\nIn the other direction, there is the modern demand for the conveniences of the first world -- electricity, telephones, transportation -- for a three-week influx of athletes, officials, news media and fans.\n''Don't worry about the stadiums and the events, the burden is going to be on the people who attend, the movie extras,'' said David D'Alessandro, the chairman and chief executive of John Hancock Financial Services, a major Olympic sponsor.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nIn early August, four-year locusts from major American corporations will descend on Athens -- with gluttonous appetites for golf courses, shopping, air-conditioning, familiar food.

The Athens experience will force the Games to go on a diet and get healthy again.\nThe selection to be the host of the Games is seen as a blessing, but it is more of a curse. The Greeks may talk about improving their infrastucture, but even if there had not been massive dawdling at the start, Athens tried to do too much.\n''The I.O.C. has to be more in control,'' DeFrantz said yesterday, adding that all host cities need to be encouraged not to overbuild or aim for extravagant architecture in the Olympic sites. She added, ''I'm one for temporary facilities,'' or using existing ones, as her adopted home of Los Angeles did in 1984.\nAthens and the I.O.C. are reacting to the need for greater security in the wake of 9/11. But DeFrantz recalls armed soldiers guarding her hallway in the athletes village in Montreal in 1976, when she was a bronze-medalist rower. (''We tried to trade for their uniforms,'' she recalled.)\nAs we head toward the compromised dreams of Athens, the world of sport must look ahead.\n''I think Rogge has done a good job of control,'' D'Alessandro said, referring to tighter I.O.C. supervision of host cities in recent years.\n''But maybe we ought to narrow it down to 8 or 10 cities that can afford the Games, and rotate them,'' D'Alessandro added.\nSome cities, like Los Angeles, Barcelona, Seoul, Sydney and Beijing, have enough money and expertise to take on the Games. But Latin America, Africa and much of Asia and parts of Europe simply cannot live up to modern demands.\n''I was at a meeting recently and a representative of Cuba wanted to make sure that countries that size could be hosts of the Olympics, and I was thinking, 'That just isn't going to happen,' '' said Bill Martin, the acting president of the United States Olympic Committee, who visited Athens a month ago.

''Herat is the leader in reconstruction, and even our enemies cannot deny it,'' he said in a written message read at the burial. ''This is why Herat was subjected to such a plot.''\nHafiz Mansur, an editor and vocal critic of the government, said, ''I cannot say the government was behind the attack, but the position the government was taking was not fair.'' He also suggested that there might be a foreign hand behind the incident, an oblique criticism of the strong American backing for Mr. Karzai.\nMr. Naibzadah, in interviews with news agencies since his flight from Herat, said Mr. Khan's forces attacked first. He said Mr. Khan had turned against him because of ideological differences, and because the governor refused to respect the central government's authority.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nMr. Khan walked beside his son's coffin as it was pulled on a gun-carriage through the streets and laid it on the hilltop as a crowd seethed around him. For a moment, he sat in silent prayer amid hundreds of chanting mourners.Father of Slain Afghan Minister Demands Government Action", "More than dozen bidders, including Barclay brothers of Britain, submit preliminary offers for all or parts of Conrad M Black's publishing empire Hollinger International; some bidders noted; Hollinger Inc, which holds Lord Black's controlling interest in Hollinger International, secures $7.4 million it needed to make interest payment that was due March 1 (M)More than a dozen bidders, including the Barclay brothers of Britain, submitted preliminary offers yesterday for all or parts of Conrad M. Black's publishing empire, Hollinger International, executives involved in the auction said.\nThe list of those interested in Hollinger's assets, which include The Daily Telegraph of London, The Jerusalem Post, The Chicago Sun-Times and more than 100 smaller publications, are Gannett, the Tribune Company, Daily Mail and General Trust, CanWest Global Communications Corporation, the Carlyle Group and Providence Equity Partners, 3i Group, Apax Partners, Axel Springer Verlag of Berlin, the billionaire Haim Saban, Richard Desmond's Northern & Shell, and Cinven, a private equity group, the executives said.\nHollinger International put itself up for sale last fall as Lord Black, its controlling shareholder, and other executives were being accused of accepting millions of dollars of improperly authorized and insufficiently disclosed payments. Amid mounting criticism from institutional shareholders and a looming Securities and Exchange Commission investigation, Lord Black stepped down as chief executive and then tried to sell his controlling stake to the Barclay brothers without the board's knowledge. A Delaware court last month in effect blocked the sale.\nHollinger International had set a deadline of 5 p.m. yesterday for bidders to submit the outline of a deal. The broad instructions meant that many bidders submitted multipart offers, the executives said, which potentially complicates the process.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nHollinger International and its adviser, Lazard, hope to evaluate the preliminary offers in the next two weeks, the executives said. At that point, the list of bidders will be pruned and those that remain will be given access to confidential internal company documents before submitting a second round of more tightly crafted bids. A spokeswoman for Hollinger International declined to comment.More Than a Dozen Bidders Express Interest in Hollinger", "Nigerian National Petroleum Corp says its oil and gas reserves have not been affected by Royal Dutch/Shell Group's recent reduction of its estimates of proven reserves in country (M)Nigeria's national oil company says its oil and gas reserves have not been affected by the Royal Dutch/Shell Group's recent reduction of its estimates of proven reserves in the country.\nIn January, Shell stunned investors by reducing its global reserve estimates by 3.9 billion barrels, or 20 percent, including a large but unspecified cut in Nigeria. On Friday, after an article in The New York Times reported on internal company documents that recommended confidential treatment for Nigeria, the company disclosed Nigeria's share was 1.3 billion barrels.\nThat same day, Shell's outside lawyers were contacted by ''a representative of the U.S. Attorney's office in Manhattan,'' a Shell spokesman, Simon Buerk, said on Tuesday, confirming a report last week in The Times that the Justice Department had started an inquiry into the company's disclosures.\nA statement provided on Monday by the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, responding to questions submitted a week ago, said Shell's revision did not affect Nigeria's position because of different standards of reporting reserves. Nigerian national standards, according to the statement, allow reserves to be reported even if they have only a 10 percent chance of being recovered. The more rigorous regulatory standard, under which Shell and other publicly traded companies operate, only allows those with a 90 percent chance of recovery with existing wells and equipment to be reported as proven reserves.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nAnother difference is that proven reserves, under the Securities and Exchange Commission definition, involve a financial commitment to extract the resource, while Nigeria's standards are focused on the geological resources.Nigeria Says Reserves Are Unaffected by Shell Cuts", "Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co is returning about $5.9 billion to investors after more than tripling their money from holdings in companies including insurance broker Willis Group Holdings of London (S)Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Company is returning about $5.9 billion to investors after more than tripling their money from holdings in companies including the insurance broker Willis Group Holdings of London.\nLed by first cousins Henry Kravis and George Roberts, Kohlberg Kravis sold shares of five companies last year and used the proceeds to pay investors about $3.2 billion, up from $900 million in 2002.\nThe firm, which is based in New York, told its financial backers that they would get another $2.7 billion from stock sales by the end of June.\nKohlberg Kravis, along with other buyout firms including the Carlyle Group, are taking advantage of last year's surge in stock prices to sell assets.
